WORKFLOW:

https://xkcd.com/1806/ : scroll wheel undo/redo

[1:33:59 AM] Jonas Wæver: One is ghost connections, which is when you delete a connection but it seems to still be there in the graph view - you can click on empty space sometimes and a deleted connection will show up as highlighted
EDITING A NODE WILL POTENTIALLY RESIZE IT WHICH CAN MOVE THE CONNECTOR POSITIONS POTENTIALLY WITHOUT UPDATING THE QUAD TREE

I may have fixed this. Waiting on feedback:
[1:34:11 AM] Jonas Wæver: The other, which I suspect is related, is when the editor loses track of where a connector is
[1:34:39 AM] Jonas Wæver: So you can click on a connector and nothing happens, or you can click and hold on another connector and drag it to the connector and it'll fail to connect
[1:34:51 AM] Jonas Wæver: In those cases though, strangely, if you hold down Shift it can still snap to the "broken" connector

P3	Scroll bar for node editor is a bit messed up

P4	Handle user specifying a default value for a parameter that is outside the acceptable range
    This seems to be mostly done for integers (TODO: copy for decimals) but there is an outstanding issue
	where the numeric up down is not informed when the integer type changes (and thus the range is no longer correct.)

P5	Handle changes to domain dynamically affecting conversations
		- Warn when removing things that are in use
		- constrain defaults for custom numeric types based on min/max

P3	Unity color scheme whole application
	- Customize Node editors
	- Search and Replace dialog
	- Message boxes
	- Border for title bar

P5	Combobox list close window on second arrow click

P6	Node avoidance line drawing

	A way to move domain nodes between files without losing their IDs (copy-paste will make a copy)
	Autosave
	error report including project content

Error Checkers:
P2	Separate error checkers for domains

TECHNICAL DEBT

P5	Move project serialization code out of editor project?
