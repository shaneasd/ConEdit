WORKFLOW:

Figure out a way to allow the user to specify the order of parameters when defining a node type (jonas wants an integer id)
localized string that is missing localization saves to localization file as "Missing Localization"
read all conversation files in parallel assuming load time is bound by cpu and not disk
dragging lots of nodes around on a large conversation has poor performance because of the constant adding/removing to/from the quad tree.

Investigate construction of dynamicenumeration data sources. It seems like we create a whole bunch in the TypeSet and then migrate them all into the sources created by the project.

Editor crashes if integer definition used in a conversation does not exist in domain

P4	Handle user specifying a default value for a parameter that is outside the acceptable range
    This seems to be mostly done for integers (TODO: copy for decimals) but there is an outstanding issue
	where the numeric up down is not informed when the integer type changes (and thus the range is no longer correct.)

P5	Handle changes to domain dynamically affecting conversations
		- Warn when removing things that are in use
		- constrain defaults for custom numeric types based on min/max

P3	Unity color scheme whole application
	- Customize Node editors
	- Search and Replace dialog
	- Message boxes
	- Border for title bar

P6	Node avoidance line drawing

	A way to move domain nodes between files without losing their IDs (copy-paste will make a copy)
	Autosave
	error report including project content

Error Checkers:
P2	Separate error checkers for domains
