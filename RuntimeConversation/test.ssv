BarksPoliceDanish.xml; PoliceDanishA; You're lucky I was the one who found you. You gotta be more careful.; You're lucky I was the one who found you. You gotta be more careful.; 
PoliceExterior.xml; PoliceDanishStreet; Hov frøken, du må da ikke være her. Hvordan er du kommet forbi vagterne på broen?; Miss, you're not allowed to be here. How did you get past the guards on the bridge?; Polite but stern.
PoliceExterior.xml; Player; ; Hello, I am sorry my Danish isn't very good. Do you speak English?; Apologetic.
PoliceExterior.xml; PoliceDanishStreet; ; Uhm, uh yes, okay.; Hesitant.
PoliceExterior.xml; Player; ; Great, thank you so much. My name is Katarzyna Sobchak, I work for SecuCorp. Your men in the ministry of finance called us to report that the security system in the ministry has broken down, you have heard of this, yes?; 
PoliceExterior.xml; PoliceDanishStreet; ; I haven't heard anything about that.; 
PoliceExterior.xml; Player; ; Okay well you guys really need to start talking to each other, but that's none of my business. Anyway the ministry has a maintenance contract with us, and I'm here to fix the security system. Can I go through now please?; Sighs.
PoliceExterior.xml; PoliceDanishStreet; ; No uh, listen - I haven't heard anything about the security system breaking down. I'm under strict orders not to let anybody through here until tomorrow, the entire island is cordoned off for the murder investigation.; 
PoliceExterior.xml; Player; ; All the more reason to get the security system up and running as fast as possible, you see?; 
PoliceExterior.xml; PoliceDanishStreet; ; I don't know...; 
PoliceExterior.xml; Player; ; Call them up on your radio and ask. It's okay, I'll wait.; Impatient.
PoliceExterior.xml; PoliceDanishStreet; Yes, of course. Central, det er Villumsen.; Yes, of course. Central, this is Villumsen.; Second sentence is spoken into his radio.
PoliceExterior.xml; PoliceRadio; Her er centralen. Send.; This is Central. Transmit.; 
PoliceExterior.xml; PoliceDanishStreet; Har I hørt, om sikkerhedssystemet skulle være nede i Finansministeriet? Skifter.; Did you hear about the security system being down in the Ministry of Finance? Over.; Speaking into his radio.
PoliceExterior.xml; PoliceRadio; Øjeblik.; Hang on.; 
PoliceExterior.xml; PoliceRadio; Ja, der indgik en rapport for lidt siden. De har oplevet en eller anden form for nedbrud, der er tilkaldt en tekniker.; Yeah, we received a report a moment ago. They've experienced some form of breakdown. A technician has been called.; 
PoliceExterior.xml; PoliceDanishStreet; Godt så, tak for det. Hav en god aften. Slut. (To Katya) All right miss, sounds like you're needed in the ministry.; All right then, thank you. Have a nice evening. Out. (To Katya) All right miss, sounds like you're needed in the ministry.; Speaking into his radio.
PoliceExterior.xml; Player; ; Thank you, will you call your colleagues and let them know I'm coming, so I don't get shot?; 
PoliceExterior.xml; PoliceDanishStreet; ; I will. But be sure not to enter the courtyard, stay in the garden and the ministry itself. The castle is strictly off limits.; Polite and relieved to have settled the matter.
PoliceExterior.xml; Player; ; Duly noted. Have a good night, officer.; 
PoliceExterior.xml; PoliceRadio; Det har vi ikke fået nogen rapport om. Sidder du inde med nye oplysninger?; We haven't received any report about that. Do you have new information?; 
PoliceExterior.xml; PoliceDanishStreet; Nej nej, jeg har bare en tekniker her, der siger, at hun er blevet tilkaldt for at fikse systemet derovre.; No no, I just have a technician here who claims to have been called to fix the system over there.; Speaking into his radio.
PoliceExterior.xml; PoliceRadio; Nå, men det kender vi altså ikke noget til.; Well, we don't know anything about that.; 
PoliceExterior.xml; PoliceDanishStreet; Okay tak for det. Slut. (To Katya) I'm sorry miss, nobody has heard about a problem. I have to ask you to leave now, please.; Okay, thanks. Out. I'm sorry miss, nobody has heard about a problem. I have to ask you to leave now, please.; Speaking into his radio.
PoliceExterior.xml; Player; ; Damnit. Okay. Do you mind if I stick around for a few minutes so I can call my boss? Maybe he sent me to the wrong place.; 
PoliceExterior.xml; PoliceDanishStreet; ; Hmm. All right, but stay out here on the street, the garden is closed tonight.; 
PoliceExterior.xml; Player; ; Thank you officer. Have a good night.; 
CopsOverheardFootball.xml; PoliceDanish01; Fik du set kampen igår?; Did you watch the game yesterday?; 
CopsOverheardFootball.xml; PoliceDanish02; Kun første halvleg, så blev det for deprimerende. 6-1 til AGF, mand. Sådan en kamp er jo ikke spændende.; Only the first half, then it got too depressing. 6-1 to AGF, man. A game like that isn't exciting.; 
CopsOverheardFootball.xml; PoliceDanish01; Mølby fik da scoret et enkelt mål i anden halvlej.; Mølby did manage to score one goal in the second half.; Consolingly.
CopsOverheardFootball.xml; PoliceDanish02; Det er ikke så sjovt at holde med AaB i år. Jeg overvejer at blive FCK supporter.; It's not much fun to cheer on AaB this year. I'm thinking about becoming an FCK supporter.; Half-joking.
CopsOverheardFootball.xml; PoliceDanish01; Var din tunge!; Watch your mouth!; Jokingly admonishing.
CopsOverheardFootball.xml; PoliceDanish02; (Klukker); (Chuckles); 
CopsOverheardMainEntrance.xml; PoliceDanish03; Hvem i Helvede satte en sten i klemme i døren?; Who the hell used a rock to keep the door open? ; Angry.
CopsOverheardMainEntrance.xml; PoliceDanish04; Det ved jeg ikke, hvad er problemet?; I don't know. What's the problem?; Nonchalant.
CopsOverheardMainEntrance.xml; PoliceDanish03; Vi er i højeste beredskab jo, sikkerheden skal være upåklagelig!; We're at the highest state of alert, security needs to be impeccable!; 
CopsOverheardMainEntrance.xml; PoliceDanish04; Tror du KGB kommer og sniger et hold spioner ind når jeg vender ryggen til?; You think KGB will come and sneak a team of spies in while my back is turned?; Moderately sarcastic.
CopsOverheardMainEntrance.xml; PoliceDanish03; Sørg for at det ikke sker igen, okay? Ellers får inspektøren det at vide.; Make sure it doesn't happen again, okay? Otherwise the Sergeant will know about it.; Calming down a little, but still stern.
CopsOverheardMainEntrance.xml; PoliceDanish04; Ja ja.; Yeah sure.; Calming.
CopsOverheardAbsalonOffice.xml; PoliceDanish05; Nogen ind eller ud den sidste time?; Anybody in or out in the last hour?; 
CopsOverheardAbsalonOffice.xml; PoliceDanish06; Nej, der sker ikke en skid her. Sig mig lige, hvorfor er det vi skal stå 30 mand klokken lort om natten og blokere helt for traffikken rundt om Christiansborg bare fordi PET har skudt en eller anden sekretær?; Nah, not a damn thing going on here. Tell me something, why is it we have to put 30 men here in the middle of the night and block all traffic around Christiansborg just because PET shot some secretary?; Tired, bored, and impatient.
CopsOverheardAbsalonOffice.xml; PoliceDanish05; De tror han var spion jo – de er bange for at nogen kommer og forstyrrer gerningsstedet inden de har fået kigget det ordentligt igennem.; They think he was a spy, right? They're afraid that somebody will come in and disturb the crime scene before they finish examining it properly. ; Chuckling.
CopsOverheardAbsalonOffice.xml; PoliceDanish06; Kunne de ikke bare have taget det hele med?; Couldn't they just have brought it all with them?; 
CopsOverheardAbsalonOffice.xml; PoliceDanish05; Det gør de også i nat – så kommer de med en varevogn og ribber kontoret fuldstændigt, så Folketinget kan komme tilbage på arbejde.; They will, tonight - they'll bring a van and clean the office out completely so the parliament can get back to work. ; 
CopsOverheardAbsalonOffice.xml; PoliceDanish06; Det bliver de nok glade for, politikerne – de har jo brug for al den tid, de kan få, til at gå og blande sig i andre menneskers job.; I'm sure they'll be grateful, the politicians - they do need all the time they can get to put their nose in other people's jobs.; Disdainful.
CopsOverheardAbsalonOffice.xml; PoliceDanish05; Klap lige hesten Mogens Glistrup. Din vagt slutter om tre kvarter, så kan du komme hjem og få lidt søvn.; Calm down, Mogens Glistrup. Your shift ends in 45 minutes, then you can go home and get some sleep.; Amused.
PoliceDanishA.xml; PoliceDanishA; Er det ikke lidt sent sådan at rumstere omkring?; Quite a late hour to be rummaging about.; Suspicious.
PoliceDanishA.xml; PoliceDanishA; Go' aften.; Good evening.; Polite.
PoliceDanishA.xml; PoliceDanishA; Passer gaden.; Move along.; Stern.
CopsOverheardGarden.xml; PoliceDanish07; Hvorfor er det lige vi lukker hele Slotsholmen på grund af et enkelt mord? Er det ikke lidt i overkanten?; Why is it we've closed all of Slotsholmen because of a single murder? Isn't that a bit over the top?; 
CopsOverheardGarden.xml; PoliceDanish08; Eneste jeg ved er, at PET er involveret. Gætter på han var spion, ham der blev skudt.; Only thing I know is that PET is involved. I'm guessing he was a spy, the guy who got shot.; 
CopsOverheardGarden.xml; PoliceDanish07; Hva’ fa’en er der at spionere for på Christiansborg?; What the hell is there to spy on in Christiansborg?; 
CopsOverheardGarden.xml; PoliceDanish08; Kan være han ikke lige havde fået at vide, at den Kolde Krig er overstået.; Maybe he just hadn't been told that the Cold War is over.; 
CopsOverheardBarricadeNorth.xml; PoliceDanish09; Hva’ var det for et problem, Petter havde?; What was the problem Petter had?; 
CopsOverheardBarricadeNorth.xml; PoliceDanish10; Det var bare en fuld grønlænder der stod og skabte sig.; It was just a drunk Greenlander who was acting out.; 
CopsOverheardBarricadeNorth.xml; PoliceDanish09; Fik I ham smidt væk?; Did you get rid of him?; 
CopsOverheardBarricadeNorth.xml; PoliceDanish10; Ja ja, han skulle bare lige køle lidt ned. Det er s’gu lidt trist egentligt.; Yeah yeah, he just had to cool off a little. It's kind of sad, really.; 
CopsOverheardBarricadeNorth.xml; PoliceDanish09; Grønlændere?; Greenlanders?; 
CopsOverheardBarricadeNorth.xml; PoliceDanish10; Nu er grønlændere jo ikke de eneste, der nogen gange har problemer med alkohol.; Greenlanders aren't the only people who sometimes have trouble with alcohol, you know.; 
CopsOverheardBarricadeNorth.xml; PoliceDanish09; Næh det er vel rigtig nok.; Nah I guess that's right.; 
RadioMessages.xml; Martin; ; Looks like there's more cover in the pit, but the patrols are a bit tighter. It's your call.; 
RadioMessages.xml; Martin; ; Got it! Thanks for hooking us up.; 
RadioMessages.xml; Player; ; I'm in position.; Half-whispering
RadioMessages.xml; Martin; ; Testing, one-two. Do you hear me?; 
RadioMessages.xml; Player; ; Loud and clear.; 
RadioMessages.xml; Martin; ; Everything's looking good on my end. How are you doing?; Tense but professional
RadioMessages.xml; Player; ; Scared shitless.; Under her breath
RadioMessages.xml; Martin; ; Do you need a minute?; 
RadioMessages.xml; Player; ; I'm ready.; Determined
RadioMessages.xml; Martin; ; Then let's go.; 
RadioMessages.xml; Martin; ; By the way, what's with the headphones?; Honest question
RadioMessages.xml; Player; ; I like the look.; Dismissive
RadioMessages.xml; Martin; ; Heh, yeah. But seriously though.; 
RadioMessages.xml; Player; ; Let's say things go a bit wrong, and suddenly I need to leave very quickly.; 
RadioMessages.xml; Martin; ; Uh-huh.; Indicating for her to go on
RadioMessages.xml; Player; ; I'm wearing sneakers and a hoodie. All I need to do is pop on the headphones, and I'm just some girl out for a run.; 
RadioMessages.xml; Martin; ; Huh. Cool.; Mildly impressed
RadioMessages.xml; Martin; ; Very helpful of you to wear that wolf collar... to make it easier for the bad guys to strangle you to death.; Teasing
RadioMessages.xml; Player; ; No need to worry, it's a magnetic clasp, it's too weak for murder.; Dead-pan
RadioMessages.xml; Martin; ; Ah, that makes sense.; 
RadioMessages.xml; Player; ; And since you seem to have not noticed it, we are the bad guys tonight.; Joking darkly - stress on "we"
RadioMessages.xml; Martin; ; Camera is blacked out, hurry along before I draw too much attention!; 
RadioMessages.xml; Martin; ; Wait! There's a camera up ahead. Maybe see if you can find the PC it's connected to, then I can take it out for you.; 
Radko.xml; Radko; ; Yekaterina Ilyinichna, I was wondering when you would pay me a visit.; Friendly.
Radko.xml; Player; ; Just Katya will be fine, Major Cibulka.; Polite.
Radko.xml; Radko; ; Then I am just Radko to you. We were not properly introduced before your "promotion", but now that you're on the field team, I expect I will see a lot of you down here.; 
Radko.xml; Player; ; You will assign me my equipment, yes?; 
Radko.xml; Radko; ; Nothing quite so regimented. We have no access to official supply channels, so in principle, KBE has no equipment to give you.; 
Radko.xml; Player; ; I really hope there is a but.; Skeptical.
Radko.xml; Radko; ; I will use my connections to acquire weapons and gear for you. Our chieftain has given me a budget to secure a basic selection, but when you have to buy from smugglers and terrorists, everything is a little more expensive.; 
Radko.xml; Player; ; I'll take what I can get.; Shrugging.
Radko.xml; Radko; ; Admirable attitude, but you can help me expand our options.; Amused.
Radko.xml; Player; ; Shall I host a fundraiser?; Joking.
Radko.xml; Radko; ; Just keep an eye out for valuable intel when you're in the field. Not just valuable to us, but to potential third parties. I've got extensive black market contacts.; 
Radko.xml; Player; ; You are really living up to Eastern European stereotypes, Radko.; Amused.
Radko.xml; Radko; ; That's why I'm here. Bring me what you find - intel, trade secrets, blackmail material... I'll find a buyer and add the profits to our field operations fund to pay for gear. The more data we sell, the more credibility we will build, and the more materiel we will have access to.; 
Radko.xml; ; ; Your Russian is very good.; 
Radko.xml; Radko; ; Probably better than my Czech these days. I've been Russian longer than I was Czech - I've probably been speaking Russian longer than you, my dear.; 
Radko.xml; Player; ; I've read your file--; 
Radko.xml; Radko; ; Yes, and one day I'll tell you some of the things that aren't in that file, but not today.; 
Radko.xml; ; ; Thank you. I'll see you before the next mission.; 
Radko.xml; Radko; ; Good. I'll let you know when I manage to establish new supply channels.; 
Radko.xml; ; ; So what are my options for now?; 
Radko.xml; Radko; ; You'll be familiar with the SR1 Vektor. Standard issue FSB sidearm. Includes silencer, of course, and comes with your choice of Ball or Airfoil bullets. It's a good all-round weapon, but ammunition will be difficult to come by in the field.
; 
Radko.xml; Player; ; If I ever run out of bullets, I suspect I've found a problem that is too big to be solved with more bullets.; Sarcastic.
Radko.xml; Radko; ; I've also scrounged up a crate of American surplus fragmentation grenades, as well as some standard flashbang grenades. If nothing else, they'll make for a great distraction.; 
Martin.xml; Martin; ; Had a chance to talk to Daniel yet?; 
Martin.xml; Player; ; No, he's in the hospital - for a couple of weeks, I think.; 
Martin.xml; Martin; ; Me neither. Does it seem like a bad move to you, recruiting him just like that?; 
Martin.xml; Player; ; Why?; 
Martin.xml; Martin; ; Don't get me wrong, I'm happy we saved his bacon - and thanks for taking the initiative on that one by the way. Nobody deserves whatever those asshates were about to do to him.; 
Martin.xml; Martin; ; There's just something shady about that whole situation, to me. Maybe it's nothing. I just wouldn't trust him this easily.; 
Martin.xml; Player; ; He's a CIA man.; 
Martin.xml; Martin; ; That doesn't mean anything. He could still be a plant, or something. What if he reports back to his old handler? If CIA upper management ever found out what's going on here, we'd all be done.; 
Martin.xml; Player; ; You're being paranoid.; 
Martin.xml; Martin; ; Am I?; 
Martin.xml; Player; ; And in any case, we need a proper field man.; 
Martin.xml; Martin; ; You and I did just fine in Mexico. Better than some fast talker in a cheap suit.; 
Martin.xml; Player; ; If you're worried you'll be partnered up with him, you can relax. I think Josiah has more of a solo role in mind for him.; 
Martin.xml; Martin; ; I just think this is all too damn convenient.; 
Martin.xml; Player; ; We'll keep an eye on him.; 
Sarah.xml; Sarah; ; Is there anything I can help you with?; 
Sarah.xml; ; ; What makes you think Danny's incident is related to our mandate?; 
Sarah.xml; Sarah; ; It follows the same pattern: by all accounts his cover was secure. He doesn't seem to have made any mistakes, one day they just took him to the basement and tried to kill him.; 
Sarah.xml; Player; ; I don't know, that seems a little weak.; Skeptical
Sarah.xml; Sarah; ; We're seeing clear connections to some of the other deaths - particularly Deniro and Vedenina. The only thing that points in the other direction is that he's a bit wet behind the ears - all our other victims have been veterans.; 
Sarah.xml; ; ; Walk me through the list?; 
Sarah.xml; Sarah; ; All right, chronologically: Pyotr Kisselov, Russian SVR, was executed by gunshot on February 24 - we believe the Chechens did it, but it may have been Mujahideen. As far as we know, nobody even knew he was there.; 
Sarah.xml; Sarah; ; Alexander Deniro, CIA,was working on Colombian drug production. He was found beheaded behind his hotel on March 14, probably by the Norte del Valle Cartel, but it may also have been FARC. ; 
Sarah.xml; Sarah; ; Enrique Pascual, CIA veteran, now Interpol. Apparently drove his car off a cliff with his whole family in it, but he was probably pushed. He was working against ETA, the basque separatists, so they're an obvious suspect. Further, he died 3 days after Deniro, and we know ETA has connections to FARC.; 
Sarah.xml; Sarah; ; Do you want me to go on?; 
Sarah.xml; ; ; I get the picture.; 
Sarah.xml; Sarah; ; It's not an uplifting topic, I know. Was there anything else?; 
Sarah.xml; ; ; How do we know their deaths were related?; 
Sarah.xml; Sarah; ; We're not sure about all of them, but the murderboard shows the connections we've established. Some of them died within days of each other, and nobody knows how they were compromised. It all points to a leak of some sort. ; 
Sarah.xml; ; ; I'll talk to you later.; 
Sarah.xml; Sarah; ; Right, I should get back to work.; 
Sarah.xml; ; ; Sure.; 
Sarah.xml; Sarah; ; Julia Hughes and Dmitri Loshchilov died two days apart in April, in the Middle East. Mrs. Hughes was investigating nuclear proliferation for the CIA, Loshchilov was spying on Iran for SVR. We're suspecting Pakistanian ISI or Iran's VEVAK in both cases. ; 
Sarah.xml; Sarah; ; Hughes fell to her death from her room on the 16th floor of a hotel in Doha, Qatar. Loshchilov died of asphyxia - we haven't had access to the autopsy of course, but it sounds like he was poisoned with strychnine.; 
Sarah.xml; Sarah; ; Mariya Vedenina died June 11 in Saint Petersburg. She was deep cover for FSB inside the Grekov gang. Stabbed nine times in the chest, then had her throat slit.; 
Sarah.xml; Player; ; Jesus.; Shocked.
Sarah.xml; Sarah; ; And last: Chen Wing Yan, CIA. We're not sure about him, it's been difficult to establish connections to the other deaths. He was spying on the Chinese authorities in Hong Kong, but we think one of the triads may have killed him. He was strangled to death.; 
Sarah.xml; Player; ; And now this Absalon guy. That's a lot of dead people.; 
Sarah.xml; ; ; Who were the victims of the assassinations we're investigating?; 
Sarah.xml; Sarah; ; Seven intelligence officers have died this year, not including Absalon. Our backers believe their deaths are related, so we're acting on that assumption until we find evidence to the contrary.; 
Sarah.xml; Sarah; ; So far the pattern looks clear. They were all veterans of the cold war. They were all still in active service, and as far as everyone knew up to their deaths, all their covers were solid.; 
Sarah.xml; ; ; Just passing through.; 
Sarah.xml; Sarah; ; Ms. Kozlova. I suppose I should congratulate you on your promotion.; Cold, but polite.
Sarah.xml; Player; ; That would make sense...; 
Sarah.xml; Sarah; ; I mean no disrespect, but are you sure you're ready for this?; 
Sarah.xml; Player; ; For... this conversation?; Being a smartass.
Sarah.xml; Sarah; ; I've read your file, I know about your work against Black Sickle, but our mission is altogether very different. You'll not be spying on friends, this will be smash and grab work. You'll be dealing with well trained security people.; 
Sarah.xml; Player; ; Cut the bullshit please.; Matter-of-fact.
Sarah.xml; Sarah; ; All right. I just don't think you're the right person for the job. This is commando work or deep cover work. You're a technician, you haven't trained for this.; 
Sarah.xml; Player; ; You think you know everything about me because you read my file? You saw me in Mexico.; Slightly annoyed.
Sarah.xml; Sarah; ; Mexico City was great work, we were all impressed by the initiative you and Martin showed - but that was street thugs. Your next operations are going to require a lot more finesse.; Picking her words carefully.
Sarah.xml; Player; ; It won’t be a problem. I understand what’s at stake.; Backing off a bit, assuming a reassuring tone.
Sarah.xml; Sarah; ; Good. I hope you pull it off. Is there anything I can help you with?; Not convinced.
Sarah.xml; ; ; I'd like to brush up on the mission of the Kingbridge Executive. Can you run me through the background brief again?; 
Sarah.xml; Sarah; ; Of course. What would you like to talk about?; Pleased.
Daniel.xml; Daniel; ; You guys are not messing around. This is a very impressive compound.; Duly impressed.
Daniel.xml; Player; ; I'm told it used to be a navy installation during the first great war. Josiah is renting it from a secure storage company. Where did they put you up?; 
Daniel.xml; Daniel; ; The Green Crescent Hotel.; 
Daniel.xml; Player; ; Sounds fancy.; 
Daniel.xml; Daniel; ; It's a dump. But it beats living in a clay hut in rural Pakistan. And of course, as a business consultant hired by the Eridani Group, I'm used to makeshift accomodations. Where are you staying?; The business consultant thing is the cover KBE set up for him. Should be said with tongue in cheek.
Daniel.xml; Player; ; They found me a sublease in Famagusta. I am an electronic engineer working on Eridani’s high-altitude weather project here. Martin is in the same town, so we car pool.; 
Daniel.xml; Daniel; ; Listen, I wanna thank you for saving my ass back in Mexico. If it weren't for you and that hacker guy--; 
Daniel.xml; Player; ; Martin.; 
Daniel.xml; Daniel; ; Right - if it weren't for you, my smile would be a whole lot less charming right now. My amigos were bringing out the tongs. It was gonna get ugly.; Grateful.
Daniel.xml; ; ; It was careless of you to get caught like that.; Frowning slightly disapprovingly.
Daniel.xml; Daniel; ; Somebody sold me out. The way they came for me... it was out of my hands.; 
Daniel.xml; Player; ; Just like your finger nails.; Darkly joking.
Daniel.xml; Daniel; ; Augh, don't even joke about that. I'm just glad you decided not to wait for the federales.; Chuckling.
Daniel.xml; Player; ; Well I'm sure you'll be a good addition to the team.; 
Daniel.xml; Daniel; ; I get the feeling you're the favourite around here, but eh... between you and me, we'll find these guys and put a stop to the leaks.; Chuckling.
Daniel.xml; ; ; You would have done the same.; Modest.
Daniel.xml; Daniel; ; I would for sure, but that's what I was trained for. You didn't have to go in for me.; 
Reinhardt.xml; Reinhardt; ; Hey Ms. Kozlova, you're an electrical engineer, right?; Cheery.
Reinhardt.xml; Player; ; Yes...; Wary.
Reinhardt.xml; Reinhardt; ; Yeah because you electrify me.; Knowingly cheesy.
Reinhardt.xml; Player; ; Oh God, why...; Exhasperated, yet amused.
ElizabethAlix.xml; ElizabethAlix; ; Um, hello? Who are you?; Confused.
ElizabethAlix.xml; Player; ; Good evening Mrs. Alix. I hope you can help me with some questions.; Polite.
ElizabethAlix.xml; ElizabethAlix; ; I don't remember scheduling any appointments this late.; Gearing up to throw Katya out.
ElizabethAlix.xml; Player; ; I don't need an appointment, I have a gun.; Still polite.
ElizabethAlix.xml; ElizabethAlix; ; What? How did you get past the guards?; Shocked, but holding her composure.
ElizabethAlix.xml; Player; ; I killed them.; Matter-of-fact.
ElizabethAlix.xml; ElizabethAlix; ; What is this about? If you're trying to scare me, you'll have no success.; Maintaining a brave face.
ElizabethAlix.xml; Player; ; I'm not here to hurt you, I just need a few answers from you, then I'll be going again.; 
ElizabethAlix.xml; ElizabethAlix; ; I'll sound the alarm.; Pushing her luck.
ElizabethAlix.xml; ; ; [Draw weapon] I would advise against it.; Casually menacing.
ElizabethAlix.xml; ElizabethAlix; ; Oh God... take it easy. Don't do anything rash.; 
ElizabethAlix.xml; Player; ; Do you think you and I can have a civilised conversation?; 
ElizabethAlix.xml; Player; ; Your company has a contract with the NSA.; 
ElizabethAlix.xml; ElizabethAlix; ; Yes.; 
ElizabethAlix.xml; Player; ; What are you developing?; 
ElizabethAlix.xml; ElizabethAlix; ; I don't know...; Nervous.
ElizabethAlix.xml; Player; ; Don't test me, Elizabeth.; Threatening.
ElizabethAlix.xml; ElizabethAlix; ; It's just a data processing project. Listen, Spectrum is a whole different kettle of fish! It's isolated from our consumer services division, with joint oversight from the NSA and the board of directors.; Starting to fear for her life, but still maintaining her composure.
ElizabethAlix.xml; ElizabethAlix; ; My people are working on algorithms for rapid processing of very large volumes of data, but I don't know what they're being used for.; 
ElizabethAlix.xml; Player; ; Who knows?; Pushing for more info.
ElizabethAlix.xml; ElizabethAlix; ; There's another facility somewhere. I'm not involved.; 
ElizabethAlix.xml; Player; ; Wen Zhi, ever heard of her?; 
ElizabethAlix.xml; ElizabethAlix; ; What? No... I haven't.; Confused.
ElizabethAlix.xml; Player; ; Michelle Chau?; 
ElizabethAlix.xml; ElizabethAlix; ; Y-- yes... Ms. Chau works at the other facility, I've met her at meetings about Spectrum. She's... a communication intelligence consultant, I think.; Surprised.
ElizabethAlix.xml; Player; ; Where might I find Ms. Chau?; 
ElizabethAlix.xml; ElizabethAlix; ; What are you going to do?; Worried.
ElizabethAlix.xml; Player; ; We're going to have a quiet, friendly chat, same as you and I are having right now.; 
ElizabethAlix.xml; ElizabethAlix; ; I don't know Chau's schedule. She doesn't work for me. I don't know when she'll be here again.; 
ElizabethAlix.xml; Player; ; You're not much help, Elizabeth.; The menace re-enters Katya's voice.
ElizabethAlix.xml; ElizabethAlix; ; I'm giving you all I know...; Anxious.
ElizabethAlix.xml; Player; ; All right. Get me access to Spectrum. I'm not leaving empty-handed.; 
ElizabethAlix.xml; ElizabethAlix; ; I'm not authorised to give anybody access. If they catch you in there, security will shoot first and ask questions later.; Anxious.
ElizabethAlix.xml; Player; ; I'll deal with security, just get me in there.; 
ElizabethAlix.xml; ElizabethAlix; ; It's just a keypad. Here, I have a note with today's code.; 
ElizabethAlix.xml; Player; ; Good. Thank you.; 
ElizabethAlix.xml; ElizabethAlix; ; Is that it? What now?; Stoically concealing a creeping dread.
ElizabethAlix.xml; ; ; You're going to have to stay in your office a bit longer.; 
ElizabethAlix.xml; ElizabethAlix; ; I understand.; Elizabeth doesn't dare to feel relief just yet.
ElizabethAlix.xml; ; ; [Knock her out] You're going to take a nap.; 
ElizabethAlix.xml; ElizabethAlix; ; What?; On the verge of tears.
ElizabethAlix.xml; ; ; Go ahead. I won't stop you.; Shrugging.
ElizabethAlix.xml; Martin; ; Good evening, Ms. Alix.; Polite.
ElizabethAlix.xml; ElizabethAlix; ; Security?; Uncertain.
ElizabethAlix.xml; Martin; ; I'm afraid not. I think it's best if you do as my friend tells you.; Friendly.
ElizabethAlix.xml; ElizabethAlix; ; Who are you?; Shocked, to Katya.
ElizabethAlix.xml; SecurityPhone; ; [Ring tone]; 3-4 second ring tone.
ElizabethAlix.xml; Player; ; I don't think anyone down there is in any shape to take your call right now.; Mock concern.
ElizabethAlix.xml; ElizabethAlix; ; What did you do to them?; Suddenly filled with dread.
ElizabethAlix.xml; SecurityPhone; ; Security office, how can I help you?; Professional.
ElizabethAlix.xml; ElizabethAlix; ; There's an armed woman in my office!; Urgent.
ElizabethAlix.xml; SecurityPhone; ; Is this a joke?; Skeptical.
ElizabethAlix.xml; ElizabethAlix; ; This is Bess Alix, get up here at once!; Angry.
ElizabethAlix.xml; SecurityPhone; ; Yes ma'am!; Urgent.
ElizabethAlix.xml; Player; ; Very quietly.; Stress on "very".
Reinhardt.xml; Reinhardt; ; Heaven must be missing an angel...; Cheesy.
Reinhardt.xml; Player; ; The only way this can possibly end is with me punching you.; Amused.
Reinhardt.xml; Reinhardt; ; Hey Katya, you dropped something.; Innocent.
Reinhardt.xml; Player; ; Give it a rest already.; Amused.
Reinhardt.xml; Reinhardt; ; Come on, play along.; Friendly.
Reinhardt.xml; Player; ; What did I drop?; 
Reinhardt.xml; Reinhardt; ; Your standards. Hi, I'm Reinhardt.; Suave.
Reinhardt.xml; Player; ; You're the worst.; Shaking her head with a smile.
Reinhardt.xml; Reinhardt; ; Do you have any raisins?; 
Reinhardt.xml; Player; ; God damnit.; Amused, but feigning exhasperation.
Reinhardt.xml; Reinhardt; ; No? Well how about a date?; 
Reinhardt.xml; Player; ; Please. Just... stop.; Mock pity.
Reinhardt.xml; Reinhardt; ; I saw a smile!; Grinning.
Reinhardt.xml; Reinhardt; ; You're so beautiful you made me forget my pick up line.; 
Reinhardt.xml; Player; ; Hah! You know, that almost would have worked, if this wasn't the dumbest, most inappropriate place to come on to me!; Laughing.
Reinhardt.xml; Reinhardt; ; Just trying to brighten up your day.; Winking.
Reinhardt.xml; Player; ; Have a good one, Reinhardt.; Friendly.
Radko.xml; Radko; ; What can I do for you today?; Service-minded.
Radko.xml; Player; ; Just swinging by to see if you have anything new for me.; Polite.
Radko.xml; Radko; ; Maybe I can tempt you with something a little more expedient? The MP5K is all the rage for wet work these days.; 
Radko.xml; Player; ; I'm breaking into office buildings, Radko - I'm not going to war.; 
Radko.xml; Radko; ; My dear, you knocked off enough people on your last mission to earn an honorary membership of the GRU.; 
Radko.xml; Player; ; Well... then I guess my pistol is just as expedient as I need, no?; 
Radko.xml; Radko; ; Touché.; 
Radko.xml; Radko; ; You shouldn't be afraid to get your hands dirty, my girl. If it's you or him, there can be no time to hesitate.; Concerned.
Radko.xml; Player; ; I am not an assassin.; Annoyed.
Radko.xml; Radko; ; No, you are completely alone, surrounded by people who will kill you or lock you up for the rest of your life. There is no place there for a conscience. ; 
Radko.xml; Player; ; If I start shooting like a maniac, it will only make things worse. ; Dismissive.
Radko.xml; Radko; ; Nevertheless--; He's cut off before he can get any further.
Radko.xml; Player; ; If it's all the same to you, Radoslav, I will stick to my pistol. ; Curt, using his full name to emphasise her severity.
Radko.xml; Radko; ; As you wish - Yekaterina.; Shrugging.
Martin.xml; Player; ; All done. Patched it through to both our offices. Are you getting a signal?; 
Martin.xml; Martin; ; Yep, looks good. I don't know what you hope to get from this though.; 
Martin.xml; Player; ; I hope to get nothing. But trusting people has bit me in the ass before, so now I like to play it safe. Thanks for your help, Martin.; 
Martin.xml; Martin; ; Yeah, sure.; Uncertain.
Martin.xml; Martin; ; Let me know when your equipment is in place.; 
Martin.xml; Player; ; Do you have a minute?; 
Martin.xml; Martin; ; Of course.; 
Martin.xml; Player; ; I need your help to bug this place.; Matter-of-fact.
Martin.xml; Martin; ; What? Why?; Slight shocked.
Martin.xml; Player; ; I just like to know what’s going on.; Shrugging.
Martin.xml; Martin; ; What do you need?; Wary.
Martin.xml; Player; ; Security does a full bug sweep every Friday. I need you to crack their software and put my equipment on the whitelist.; 
Martin.xml; Martin; ; Easy enough. Is that it?; Shrugging in agreement.
Martin.xml; Player; ; Thank you Martin, that’s all.; Katya starts to leave.
Martin.xml; Martin; ; Hey.; Means "wait"
Martin.xml; Player; ; Da?; 
Martin.xml; Martin; ; This isn’t some FSB thing, is it?; Worried.
Martin.xml; Player; ; It's just me. I’ll give you access to the feed as well, all right?; 
Martin.xml; Martin; ; Sure. Cool.; 
Debriefing.xml; Reinhardt; ; Hey guys, welcome back. How was the flight?; Friendly
Debriefing.xml; Katya; ; It was fine, thank you.; Cheerful.
Debriefing.xml; Martin; ; Long as hell. Maybe next time, we can fly business class, huh?; Wry.
Debriefing.xml; Reinhardt; ; Incredible work in Mexico. And so unexpected! We were all watching on the big screen.; 
Debriefing.xml; Josiah; ; Kozlova, Symborski - nicely done. Debriefing is in 15 minutes, my office.; Josiah enters from the side staircase and walks to the main one.
Debriefing.xml; Martin; ; No time to lose, I guess. Come on.; Slightly sarcastic, but not too negative.
Debriefing.xml; Josiah; ; Welcome back.; 
Debriefing.xml; Katya; ; Thank you.; 
Debriefing.xml; Josiah; ; How was Mexico?; 
Debriefing.xml; Martin; ; Great weather.; 
Debriefing.xml; Katya; ; Friendly people.; Sarcastic.
Debriefing.xml; Josiah; ; I'm supposed to admonish you for diverging from mission parameters and putting your lives in danger.; 
Debriefing.xml; Katya; ; Mr. Gray --; About to defend herself.
Debriefing.xml; Josiah; ; However, your actions in Mexico City are exactly what this task group needs.; 
Debriefing.xml; Katya; ; Yes sir.; Surprised.
Debriefing.xml; Josiah; ; You assessed the situation, you took a calculated risk, and it paid off. Thanks to both of you, we are able to add Daniel Mansoor to our roster as soon as he recovers from his injuries. This puts us in a much better position, going forward.; 
Debriefing.xml; Josiah; ; It's no secret we are underfunded and short-staffed. We have to do our best with the hand we've been dealt, and that means we must stay agile. We need operatives who can think on their feet and make decisions based on the information available in the field - classic spy work.; 
Debriefing.xml; Josiah; ; With that in mind, I would like to offer both of you a permanent place on the field staff.; 
Debriefing.xml; Katya; ; Thank you, Mr. Gray!; 
Debriefing.xml; Martin; ; Sir, I'm no field man. I just do computers.; Slightly alarmed.
Debriefing.xml; Josiah; ; Hear me out. I know this is not how things are normally done, but what I saw in Mexico City impressed me a great deal. It seems to me you were both integral to the success of that extraction, and I'd like to see if the success is repeatable.; 
Debriefing.xml; Katya; ; Couldn't have done it without you, Martin.; Encouraging.
Debriefing.xml; Martin; ; So... I'll stay in the van?; Mostly reassured.
Debriefing.xml; Josiah; ; You'll be on overwatch, and it'll be Ms. Kozlova's boots on the ground.; 
Debriefing.xml; Martin; ; What do you think?; Unsure.
Debriefing.xml; Katya; ; Why not? It worked once, it'll work again.; Eager.
Debriefing.xml; Josiah; ; Is that a yes?; 
Debriefing.xml; Martin; ; Sounds like it.; Tentative.
Debriefing.xml; Josiah; ; Then welcome to the field team Ms. Kozlova, Mr. Symborski.; Satisfied.
Debriefing.xml; Katya; ; Thank you sir.; 
Debriefing.xml; Martin; ; Thank you.; 
Debriefing.xml; Josiah; ; Spend the day getting the formalities out of the way and settling into your new roles. Unfortunately we have to move fast on the lead we got from Mansoor. You'll be briefed on your next operation at 5 pm, and you fly out at 8.; 
Debriefing.xml; Katya; ; Tonight?!; Disbelief.
Debriefing.xml; Josiah; ; I know we all wish we had more time to prepare, but this next one is extremely time sensitive. Like I said, we play the hand we've been dealt.; 
Debriefing.xml; Martin; ; We'll be ready.; 
Debriefing.xml; Katya; Хуй с ним.; Fuck it.; Muttering.
Debriefing.xml; Josiah; ; Good luck.; 
Briefing.xml; Josiah; First things first. Owing to our... (smiles) unexpectedly swift resolution to Mexico City, we now have a field team. Mr. Mansoor will be our singleton, and I've instated Katya and Martin as an operational unit.; First things first. Owing to our... unexpectedly swift resolution to Mexico City, we now have a field team. Mr. Mansoor will be our singleton, and I've instated Katya and Martin as an operational unit. ; 
Briefing.xml; Sarah; ; That'll have to do.; 
Briefing.xml; Josiah; ; Unfortunately there's no time to rest. CIA lost a man in Copenhagen last night - he might be relevant to our mission, and we have to strike while the iron is hot.; 
Briefing.xml; Josiah; ; His code name was Absalon. He was a NOC agent embedded in the Danish parliament as a government official.; NOC is pronounced "knock".
Briefing.xml; Josiah; At six thirty last night, the local spy shop tried to apprehend him, and apparently he started shooting. The police returned fire and shot him dead.; At 06:30 last night, the local spy shop tried to apprehend him, and apparently he started shooting. The police returned fire and shot him dead.; 
Briefing.xml; Josiah; ; Details are thin on the ground so far. Nobody knows why the Danes tried to grab him, or why he fought back. We're going to put the field team on a plane to Copenhagen in three hours, and the op itself needs to go down this evening.; 
Briefing.xml; Josiah; ; I know it's not ideal to go in with so little time to prepare, but our best hope is to search Absalon's office in the parliament building before Danish intelligence strips it clean and takes everything away.; 
Briefing.xml; Martin; ; Isn't this the kinda thing Mansoor should handle?; 
Briefing.xml; Josiah; ; Mr. Mansoor is fresh out of the torture chamber, he will need a few days to recover.; 
Briefing.xml; ; ; No time to waste then. We'll work out the rest of the details on the plane.; 
Briefing.xml; Josiah; ; Needless to say, if you get caught, no one will come for you. Hope for the best, plan for the worst. Good luck.; 
Briefing.xml; ; ; Walk us through the plan.; 
Briefing.xml; Josiah; ; Our best bet for insertion is the Copenhagen Channel. At the moment, the bank is a construction site, you can move through the mess to get past the police barriers. That'll already put you inside the perimeter, which makes things a lot easier.; 
Briefing.xml; Josiah; ; Through the library garden, you'll reach the main entrance to the palace. Unfortunately, if you go in that way, it'll be without your gun - there's a metal detector.; 
Briefing.xml; Josiah; ; Once you're inside, find Absalon's office, search for anything that might connect his death to our mission, and return to the channel for extraction.; 
Briefing.xml; ; ; Let's say I want to keep things friendly. Can you get me a pretext this quickly?; "Pretext" is spy lingo for a cover.
Briefing.xml; Sarah; ; We have some ideas, but it will be a bit flimsy.; 
Briefing.xml; Josiah; ; It would be easier if you spoke Danish.; 
Briefing.xml; Sarah; ; We can probably get you past the outer perimeter if Martin can get into the security server and disconnect the door alarms. Then you pose as a SecuCorp technician who's been called to fix them.; 
Briefing.xml; Player; ; What if they phone SecuCorp to verify?; 
Briefing.xml; Sarah; ; Your name and the dispatch will be on file, and that's usually enough for this type of blag. Of course, if they dig deeper, you'll be in trouble. That's what makes it flimsy.; 
Briefing.xml; Josiah; ; It also won't get you into the parliament building itself, but it'll justify your hanging around outside it.; 
Briefing.xml; Player; ; What's still a lot less trouble than playing hide and seek with the police.; 
Briefing.xml; Josiah; ; Exactly.; 
Josiah.xml; Josiah; ; Come on in, Ms. Kozlova. How are you doing?; 
Josiah.xml; Player; ; I have some concerns about the way we run our operations.; Severe but polite.
Josiah.xml; Josiah; ; I know it's unorthodox. We're in a very unusual situation here. Our mission imposes a certain time pressure on us, and we have very limited personnel.; Nodding.
Josiah.xml; Player; ; Unorthodox is not the word I would use. Insane, maybe. I'm not a commando, and neither is Daniel - we're deep cover agents, and you're not giving us any time to establish a cover. ; 
Josiah.xml; Josiah; ; We're essentially writing a new doctrine. As such, I'm sure we'll run into some difficulties along the way that we'll have to solve. Do you have any specific concerns?; 
Josiah.xml; Player; ; My main concern is local assets. It takes real time to build a network.; 
Josiah.xml; Josiah; ; Right, good that you mention it. Sarah and I have been assembling a database of freelancers and low-tier agents that we've worked with in the past - people we can trust.; 
Josiah.xml; Josiah; ; Instead of trying to build a local network in each location where you'll deploy, which as you say takes more time than we can afford, we'll hire some of these agents to go in and make the necessary preparations ahead of time.; 
Josiah.xml; Player; ; How long ahead of time?; 
Josiah.xml; Josiah; ; As soon as we know where the next target is, we'll start setting things up.; 
Josiah.xml; Player; ; But not in Copenhagen.; 
Josiah.xml; Josiah; ; As I said before, nobody is happy about the time frame of this mission, but we have to beat the local authorities. We're working hard to get assets set up in the area, calling in people from Germany and Sweden...; 
Josiah.xml; Player; ; Will they make it?; 
Josiah.xml; Josiah; ; It looks like we'll have options, yeah.; 
IntroBanter.xml; Martin; ; I see you nice and clear. Oh, how helpful of you to wear that wolf collar, to make it easier for the bad guys to strangle you to death.; Sarcastic.
IntroBanter.xml; Player; ; No need to worry, it's a magnetic clasp, it's too weak for murder.; 
IntroBanter.xml; Martin; ; Ah, that makes sense.; 
IntroBanter.xml; Player; ; And since you seem to have not noticed it, we are the bad guys tonight.; Joking darkly - stress on "we"
ArchiveGuard.xml; Player; ; Good evening.; Casual.
ArchiveGuard.xml; ArchiveGuard; ; Good evening miss. I'm sorry, but the cleaning crew is not allowed down here.; Stern.
ArchiveGuard.xml; Player; ; Are you John Smith?; She makes up this name on the spot.
ArchiveGuard.xml; ArchiveGuard; ; Smith? No, my name is Dylan Gilbert.; Slightly taken aback.
ArchiveGuard.xml; Player; ; Dylan Gilbert. I see. Okay.; Nodding.
ArchiveGuard.xml; ArchiveGuard; ; I don't think we even have a John Smith here... what is this about?; Musing.
ArchiveGuard.xml; ; ; Do you worry that your wife might learn about your affair?; 
ArchiveGuard.xml; ; ; What is your employer's policy on stealing from your clients?; 
ArchiveGuard.xml; ; ; It's come to our attention that your son has tax problems.; 
ArchiveGuard.xml; ; ; [Stall] This the archive room, yes?; Deliberately vague.
ArchiveGuard.xml; ArchiveGuard; ; Yes... who are you?; 
ArchiveGuard.xml; Player; ; I was told to find the archive room and speak to the guard. I thought the name was different.; 
ArchiveGuard.xml; ArchiveGuard; ; Yeah, well... I'm on this post tonight. Now what is this about?; Annoyed.
ArchiveGuard.xml; ; ; [Keep stalling] Are you always on this post?; 
ArchiveGuard.xml; ArchiveGuard; ; Yes I'm always on this post! Every Monday the archive room is mine. ; Annoyed.
ArchiveGuard.xml; Player; ; And you weren't told that I was coming? I was led to believe that you had been informed.; 
ArchiveGuard.xml; ArchiveGuard; ; Nobody tells me anything, apparently. Maybe if you would tell me who you are and what you're doing here, we can find out if I can let you into the archive or not.; 
ArchiveGuard.xml; ; ; [Keep stalling] I'm an intern up in Central Auditing. I need to fetch some files for the internal accounting guys.; 
ArchiveGuard.xml; ArchiveGuard; ; What is your name?; 
ArchiveGuard.xml; Player; ; Yulia.; 
ArchiveGuard.xml; ArchiveGuard; ; And who is your boss?; 
ArchiveGuard.xml; Player; ; The guy who sent me is called Phil. I don't remember his last name. I'm pretty new.; 
ArchiveGuard.xml; ArchiveGuard; ; Yeah no kidding. And who the hell is Phil? Listen, I can't let you in here based on that. Tell this Phil bloke to call down himself if he needs something.; 
ArchiveGuard.xml; ; ; Never mind, I'll come back tomorrow.; 
ArchiveGuard.xml; ArchiveGuard; ; Great, can't wait. Bring Phil!; Sarcastic.
ArchiveGuard.xml; ArchiveGuard; ; Smith? No, my name is Peter McCalland.; Slightly taken aback.
ArchiveGuard.xml; Player; ; Peter McCalland. I see. Okay.; Nodding.
ArchiveGuard.xml; ArchiveGuard; ; Smith? No, my name is Tom Bryan.; Slightly taken aback.
ArchiveGuard.xml; Player; ; Tom Bryan. I see. Okay.; Nodding.
RadioMessages.xml; Player; ; I have the evidence - our assets are in the clear.; 
RadioMessages.xml; Martin; ; Oh shit. I'm seeing a lot of activity. It looks like there was a silent alarm on that door.; 
RadioMessages.xml; Player; ; Of course there was...; Exhasperated.
RadioMessages.xml; Martin; ; It's all right, we can deal with this. Let's get you to the extraction point for pick-up.; 
RadioMessages.xml; Martin; ; You're up against civilian security contractors from SafeGuard. Their standard issue is a 9mm and a twitchy trigger finger. Watch yourself in there.; 
RadioMessages.xml; Player; ; All right, I'm in position.; 
RadioMessages.xml; Martin; ; Roger that. Our local asset has given us several points of interest. We just need to get you to the indicated locations to grab any evidence of our involvement here.; 
RadioMessages.xml; Martin; ; All good on my end. Just to reiterate: we need this site pacified. Locate all hostiles and neutralise them. Dead if you must, but unconscious is fine too.; 
RadioMessages.xml; Player; ; I'm ashore. Insertion point looks clear.; 
RadioMessages.xml; Player; ; I'm off the boat, ready to proceed when you are.; 
Briefing.xml; Josiah; ; All right everyone. Before we begin the briefing, I'd just like to thank you all for the work you've put in over the past couple of weeks.; 
Briefing.xml; Josiah; ; It's been a rough start, but it feels like we've all begun to set aside our differences and get into the swing of things. Keep up the good work.; 
Briefing.xml; Josiah; ; Now, I'll let Sarah explain what the analysis department has discovered since Copenhagen, and then I'll get into the details of this next operation.; 
Briefing.xml; Sarah; ; Right! Well, thanks to the efforts of our field team, we've had full access to the data compiled by Absalon in the months leading up to his death. Absalon was charting the monetary flow from the pan-European and the South American drug trade.; 
Briefing.xml; Sarah; ; He managed to get quite close to identifying a single common destination for this money, but of course he was not an analyst. We managed to finish what he started. We've traced the accounts to a London-based financial company called Catalyst Investment Group.; 
Briefing.xml; Daniel; ; How much money are we talking about?; 
Briefing.xml; Sarah; ; On the order of hundreds of millions of dollars.; 
Briefing.xml; Daniel; ; (Impressed whistle) What's it all for?; 
Briefing.xml; Sarah; ; It's clearly some sort of money laundering scheme. Catalyst is a black hole into which staggering amounts of capital is disappearing. It must be coming out somewhere else, but we can't see past the event horizon - to maintain the metaphor.; 
Briefing.xml; Player; ; I see where this is going.; 
Briefing.xml; Sarah; ; Yes. Of course we need to get inside Catalyst. We need to get a hold of their files, both physical and digital, so we can trace the movement of the drug money through the organization and identify the recipients.; 
Briefing.xml; Martin; ; Hold the phone. How does this relate to our mission?; 
Briefing.xml; Sarah; ; This money laundering scheme is the best lead we've got. The betrayal of Absalon fits the pattern of our leaks. For now, we're assuming that whoever was responsible for our leaks also sold out Absalon and Mr. Mansoor.; 
Briefing.xml; Sarah; ; At the same time, it's clear that this scheme is at the heart of Absalon's death. Absalon and Mansoor were investigating different parts of the same criminal operation, and they were both getting very close indeed.; 
Briefing.xml; Sarah; ; We conclude that they were sold out in order to impede the investigation.; 
Briefing.xml; Martin; ; How can we know that?; 
Briefing.xml; Sarah; ; The cash flow stopped shortly after Absalon died. The operation is probably being restructured while the CIA is scrambling to establish new NOC agents. It's not conclusive evidence, but it's enough to act on.; 
Briefing.xml; Josiah; ; Thank you, Sarah.; 
Briefing.xml; Josiah; ; I've chosen to send Ms. Kozlova and Mr. Symborski to London while Mr. Mansoor will track down Absalon's German contact and establish a connection with his network in Central Europe.; 
Briefing.xml; Martin; ; WE'RE going to London?!; 
Briefing.xml; Player; ; Don't worry, we'll be fine.; 
Briefing.xml; Josiah; ; I would recommend going in light - our pretext should get you through the front door without any trouble. If you want to go in heavy, we feel the rear entrance is your best bet.; 
Briefing.xml; Josiah; ; You have two pairs of primary targets. One: our sources indicate that the chief internal auditor should have the records of which files we need - find them, then search the physical archive in the basement.; 
Briefing.xml; Josiah; ; Two: the server room is on the third floor, but first you'll need to secure a decryption key from the IT offices.; 
Briefing.xml; ; ; How's the security?; 
Briefing.xml; Josiah; ; Handled by a contractor called SafeGuard - one of the few private firms licensed to carry lethal weaponry in the UK. They're one step above mall cops, but don't underestimate them.; 
Briefing.xml; ; ; No time to waste.; 
Briefing.xml; Josiah; ; You leave tomorrow morning. Make sure you're ready for any eventuality. Good luck.; 
Briefing.xml; ; ; If I go in light, what's the pretext?; 
Briefing.xml; Josiah; ; You're on the cleaning crew. That should get you past the lobby. Once you're inside, you'll still need to keep a low profile.; 
Briefing.xml; Josiah; ; The main problem is getting past the archive guard. The only way into the archive is past a permanently staffed security desk.; 
Briefing.xml; Josiah; ; You may have to get your hands dirty at that point. Unless Mr. Symborski can dig up a pressure point for whoever's on duty when you arrive.; 
BarksSafeguardSecurity.xml; SecurityGuard; ; Huh?; Mumbled.
BarksSafeguardSecurity.xml; SecurityGuard; ; What?; Mumbled.
BarksSafeguardSecurity.xml; SecurityGuard; ; Whazzat?; Mumbled.

Katya.xml; Katya; ; Sorry my friend.; 
Katya.xml; Katya; ; Nothing personal.;

Martin.xml; Martin; ; Bye bye.;

Martin.xml; Martin; ; Yeah. He's dead.; 
Martin.xml; Martin; ; He won't be a problem anymore.; 
Martin.xml; Martin; ; Enemy down.; 
Martin.xml; Martin; ; Bad day in the office...; 
Martin.xml; Martin; ; Got one.; 
Martin.xml; Martin; ; That's the end of him.; 
Martin.xml; Martin; ; Looks like a goner.; 
Martin.xml; Martin; ; One less to worry about.; 
Martin.xml; Martin; ; Another one bites the dust.; 
Martin.xml; Martin; ; Bad way to go.; 
Martin.xml; Martin; ; He's down for good.; 
Martin.xml; Martin; ; One down.; 
Martin.xml; Martin; ; Better watch your step there, buddy.; 
Martin.xml; Martin; ; Should learn to mind his surroundings.;

Martin.xml; Martin; ; Zzzzap.; 
Martin.xml; Martin; ; Ain't enough painkillers in the world.; 
Martin.xml; Martin; ; Nighty night!; 
Martin.xml; Martin; ; Bad wiring. He should sue.; 
Martin.xml; Martin; ; Just bagged his hazard bonus for sure.; 
Martin.xml; Martin; ; Sleep tight, pal.; 
Martin.xml; Martin; ; Stay down.; 
Martin.xml; Martin; "SF" for San Fransisco, of course.; I call that The SF Suckerpunch.; 
Martin.xml; Martin; ; Hope he didn't have a pacemaker.; 
Martin.xml; Martin; ; He'll feel that one for a while.; 
Martin.xml; Martin; ; Hahah! Ouch!; 
Martin.xml; Martin; ; He ain't getting up soon.; 
Martin.xml; Martin; ; Ooh that looked like it hurt!; 
Martin.xml; Martin; ; That'll leave a mark.; 
RadioMessages.xml; Player; ; I've got what we came for. Time to leave.; 
RadioMessages.xml; Martin; ; Hold up. Looks like security just got an anonymous tip-off. They're spreading out to search the building.; 
RadioMessages.xml; Player; ; Local asset sold us out?; 
RadioMessages.xml; Martin; ; Probably. Try to get back out to the parking lot, I'll pick you up just outside the gate.; 
RadioMessages.xml; Martin; ; Security here is lightly armed, but they seem to be expecting trouble. Don't take any chances.; 
RadioMessages.xml; Martin; ; Rise and shine, Kat. The last employee has left the building. It's go time.; 
RadioMessages.xml; Player; ; Next time I'll bring a book. Let's go.; 
RadioMessages.xml; Martin; ; All right, we've got several offices to search. Once you have the intel, make your way back out here and I'll pick you up outside the gate.; 
RadioMessages.xml; Martin; ; Don't be so eager, this'll be grim work. Castle wants all security personnel neutralised. They don't need to be dead, necessarily, but we do need them incapacitated.; 
RadioMessages.xml; Player; ; I was starting to think you had forgot about me.; 
RadioMessages.xml; Player; ; Good, I'm pretty tired of this trailer.; 
RadioMessages.xml; Player; ; I have the file. I'll make my way back down.; 
RadioMessages.xml; Martin; ; Stop. Uh-oh.; 
RadioMessages.xml; Player; ; That doesn't sound good...; 
RadioMessages.xml; Martin; ; The alarm just went off. They're beginning to search the building. Keep your head down and head back to the end of the courtyard, I'll pick you up out on the street.; 
RadioMessages.xml; Martin; ; Security is pretty tight, but the guards are lightly armed. Stay on your toes.; 
RadioMessages.xml; Player; ; I've entered the courtyard. Are we good to go?; 
RadioMessages.xml; Martin; ; All good out here. Hey, don't be intimidated by the Interpol logo, this'll be a simple smash and grab job. Get in, find the intel, get back out. Easy.; 
RadioMessages.xml; Martin; ; This could get messy. Orders are to pacify the whole site - you don't need to kill anybody if you can avoid it, as long as all the lights are out, so to speak.; 
RadioMessages.xml; Player; ; I'm in position and ready to go.; 
RadioMessages.xml; Player; ; I'm inside the gate. How does it look?; 
RadioMessages.xml; Player; ; I have the intel.; 
RadioMessages.xml; Martin; ; Bad news. Looks like the safe was wired - you're about to have a lot of company. ; 
RadioMessages.xml; Player; ; I thought this seemed too easy...; 
RadioMessages.xml; Martin; ; Try to reach the warehouse lot across the street. I'll meet you in the alley and get you out of there.; 
RadioMessages.xml; Martin; ; Looks like SafeGuard has the security contract. They'll be lightly armed, but reasonably well trained. Be careful, Kat.; 
RadioMessages.xml; Player; ; All right. I've got eyes on the Helios offices.; 
RadioMessages.xml; Martin; ; I've got your feed. Our sources indicate several different rooms that hold potentially valuable intel. Once you've secured it, return to the warehouse lot for extraction.; 
RadioMessages.xml; Martin; ; All right, we've got green light from Castle. We need all security personnel neutralised - dead or unconscious, doesn't matter, as long as they're no longer a threat.; 
RadioMessages.xml; Player; ; I'm at the warehouse lot. Are you ready?; 
RadioMessages.xml; Player; ; I've reached the insertion point.; 
RadioMessages.xml; Martin; ; Damn, that safe has our mission-critical intel, but it's not online. I don't suppose it's too optimistic to hope some idiot wrote down the code and left it lying around?; Katya has found a safe that isn't connected to the network.
RadioMessages.xml; Martin; ; Uh, hmm... this safe isn't on the network. Good call, Helios. Take a look around the room and see what you can find.; Katya has found a safe that isn't connected to the network.
RadioMessages.xml; Martin; ; Whoops, I can't crack that safe. I don't suppose you brought some C4? Hm... maybe take a look around, see if you can find a way to open it?; Katya has found a safe that isn't connected to the network.
Daniel.xml; Player; ; Hey, how was Berlin?; 
Daniel.xml; Daniel; (Snorts) It was, uh... interesting.; It was, uh... interesting.; 
Daniel.xml; Player; ; It sounded like it would be a milk run.; 
Daniel.xml; Daniel; ; It did, didn't it? Let's just say things didn't go according to plan. We got what we came for though.; 
Daniel.xml; Player; ; "We?"; 
Daniel.xml; Daniel; ; Ah, yep, I made some new friends. I'll introduce you to them sometime.; 
Daniel.xml; Player; ; So enigmatic.; Poking a little fun at Daniel.
Daniel.xml; Daniel; ; How about you? I heard you pulled quite the heist in London.; 
Daniel.xml; ; ; It all went off without a hitch.; 
Daniel.xml; Daniel; ; How is it to work with Martin?; 
Daniel.xml; Player; ; He's got my back. Why?; 
Daniel.xml; Daniel; ; He just seems a bit... full of himself.; 
Daniel.xml; ; ; I haven't really noticed.; 
Daniel.xml; Daniel; ; Hm. Maybe he's only like that around me.; 
Daniel.xml; ; ; He can be a pain in the ass, but he's good at his job.; 
Daniel.xml; Daniel; ; I'll try to get used to him.; 
Daniel.xml; ; ; We pulled it off, but it wasn't easy.; Shaking her head.
Daniel.xml; Daniel; ; I don't know what Josiah's game is. He has plenty of field experience, so he must know what he's doing, but this whole outfit just seems reckless to me. ; 
Daniel.xml; Player; ; He expects a lot of us. Perhaps too much.; 
Daniel.xml; Daniel; ; Well... we're all still alive so far. Maybe it gets easier. ; 
PartyOverheard01.xml; BlasiusKapustin; ; I'll need assurances that you can deliver.; 
PartyOverheard01.xml; JerzyKwiatkowski; ; What do you take me for? Some two-bit scab?; Angrily.
PartyOverheard01.xml; BlasiusKapustin; ; I like your style. How about a trial then? 60 sleeves. If your product is good, we'll up it to 600.; Laughing.
PartyOverheard01.xml; JerzyKwiatkowski; ; When and where?; 
PartyOverheard01.xml; BlasiusKapustin; ; A week from today, Munich. I'll send the details.; Laughing.
PartyOverheard01.xml; JerzyKwiatkowski; ; You've got a deal!; 
PartyOverheard02.xml; EmmanuelAndreyev ; ; ...however, if I ever found out that someone talked, that person would want to get their affairs in order.; Stress on "if".
PartyOverheard02.xml; MiloslavHoloubek; ; (Laughs); 
PartyOverheard02.xml; EmmanuelAndreyev ; ; (Laughs mirthlessly); 
PartyOverheard02.xml; MiloslavHoloubek; ; No-- no one would be that stupid, Mr. Andreyev.; Nervous.
PartyOverheard03.xml; SpencerCoates; ; I guess I'm more one to hark back to the classical cocktails.; Pretentious.
PartyOverheard03.xml; SerafinNowicki; ; Classical cocktails?; 
PartyOverheard03.xml; SpencerCoates; ; Oh yes, nothing whets your palate like a good sazerac.; 
PartyOverheard03.xml; SerafinNowicki; ; I've never had the pleasure.; 
PartyOverheard03.xml; SpencerCoates; ; It's a New Orleans variation on a cognac cocktail - named for the eponymous spirit.; Highly pretentious.
PartyOverheard03.xml; SerafinNowicki; ; Maybe the bartender can mix up a couple?; Intrigued.
PartyOverheard04.xml; ApolinaryCzarnecki; ; Did you see Mr. Creosote over there? I swear, if he doesn't lay off the canapees, he'll burst.; Disdain.
PartyOverheard04.xml; RajmundNowak; ; And guess who is cleaning that up. Do you know what Luiza found in the 2nd floor lavatories?; 
PartyOverheard04.xml; ApolinaryCzarnecki; ; I get the feeling I don't want to know...; 
PartyOverheard04.xml; RajmundNowak; ; On. The. Walls. How do you manage that unless you're deliberately trying?; Scandalised.
PartyOverheard04.xml; ApolinaryCzarnecki; ; Ugh... rich people make me sick...; 
PartyOverheard04.xml; RajmundNowak; ; But you'd join them if you could.; Smiling.
PartyOverheard04.xml; ApolinaryCzarnecki; ; Of course. So would you.; Grinning.
PartyOverheard05.xml; IsaacDemidov; ; Hey! Champagne for me and my friend here. ; Demanding.
PartyOverheard05.xml; RajmundNowak; ; Yes, of course.; Polite.
PartyOverheard05.xml; IsaacDemidov; ; And no lip. You're paid to work, not talk. Now hurry off.; Condescending.
PartyOverheard05.xml; RajmundNowak; ; Of course.; Maintaining his polite facade.
PartyOverheard05.xml; IsaacDemidov; ; Good servants are seen, not heard.; Cheap parting shot.
PartyOverheard06.xml; PhilemonPirogov; ; ...so the vaccum left by Karadzic has affected our business in Srpska. For that, I'd shoot the bastard myself if he wasn't already dead.; 
PartyOverheard06.xml; CelinaBorkowska; ; My sister said she'd seen him in Belgrade.; Trying to join in on the conversation.
PartyOverheard06.xml; PhilemonPirogov; ; Don't be preposterous - no one found a body, but he didn't escape. What would you know about that anyway?; Irritated.
PartyOverheard06.xml; CelinaBorkowska; ; I--; Foot in mouth.
PartyOverheard06.xml; PhilemonPirogov; ; You are here to look good on my arm. Don't interrupt me when I am talking.; Cruelly dismissive.
PartyOverheard07.xml; LukasBecker; ; ...and my employer is still very upset with last month's fighting.; 
PartyOverheard07.xml; DamianAnisimov; ; Columbian revolutionaries? Yes, there was a distinct drop in export around that time.; 
PartyOverheard07.xml; LukasBecker; ; We had holdings near Guaviare - some of them were compromised. It is a bad situation.; 
PartyOverheard07.xml; DamianAnisimov; ; I will hope for a quick recovery. Our business has been amicable and very profitable in the past.; 
PartyOverheard08.xml; MuratVoronov; ; ...so they show up, trying to be nonchalant - all "may we come in and look around, sir?" Of course, my guy had called HOURS ago to let me know.; Gloating.
PartyOverheard08.xml; DorofeiKotov; ; And how'd he find out?; Curious.
PartyOverheard08.xml; MuratVoronov; ; Cop salaries are a joke. They're all bitter and greedy - it's easy to keep one on payroll... hell, he thinks he's getting a ransom when it's barely pocket change.; 
PartyOverheard08.xml; DorofeiKotov; ; It's that easy?; Amused.
PartyOverheard08.xml; MuratVoronov; Of course! The law is a sham - money makes the rules, and we... (shrugs) have the money.; Of course! The law is a sham - money makes the rules, and we... have the money.; Self-satisfied.
DebriefingHighProfile.xml; Daniel; ; Oh my god, I'm so glad to see you guys again, you have no idea.; 
DebriefingHighProfile.xml; Katya; ; How have you been, Danny?; 
DebriefingHighProfile.xml; Daniel; ; Well, I've been running for my life.; 
DebriefingHighProfile.xml; Katya; ; You're safe here, this place is secure. We've made sure of it.; 
DebriefingHighProfile.xml; Daniel; ; What about the others? Is everyone... are they all dead?; 
DebriefingHighProfile.xml; Katya; ; We think so.; 
DebriefingHighProfile.xml; Martin; ; Nobody could have made it out of there alive.; 
DebriefingHighProfile.xml; Daniel; ; So it's all over then. We're all that's left.; 
DebriefingHighProfile.xml; Katya; ; It's not over. I will not let it end like this.; 
DebriefingHighProfile.xml; Daniel; ; You have a plan?; 
DebriefingHighProfile.xml; Katya; ; Step one: recover what we've lost. Martin.; Prompting Martin to elaborate.
DebriefingHighProfile.xml; Martin; ; We need to re-establish our satcom access. I believe Josiah had some black ops access codes. It's possible they were all removed or revoked during the raid, in which case we'll be flying blind from now on.; 
DebriefingHighProfile.xml; Martin; ; But if I know Josiah well enough, he had contingencies. If we find the codes, and if they still work, we can secure an overhead platform.; 
DebriefingHighProfile.xml; Katya; ; Step two: The Kingbridge network.; 
DebriefingHighProfile.xml; Daniel; ; Radoslav's black market contacts?; 
DebriefingHighProfile.xml; Katya; ; Radko was old-fashioned. He had a little black book with names and secure phone lines. We need to re-establish our supply lines, so hopefully his contacts are still willing to work with us.; 
DebriefingHighProfile.xml; Martin; ; We'll also need to download the KBE Database from the Analysis Office so we can restore contact with Kingbridge's network of support assets for one last mission. Which brings us to step three:; 
DebriefingHighProfile.xml; Katya; ; Find and capture Christopher Grishin.; 
DebriefingHighProfile.xml; Daniel; ; Why? Why go after Grishin? CIA and FSB want nothing to do with us anymore, that much is clear. Why don't we just cut and run?; 
DebriefingHighProfile.xml; Katya; ; If we run now, we'll be running forever. We need to get Grishin so we can end it now, once and for all.; 
DebriefingHighProfile.xml; Daniel; ; You'll trade him in?; 
DebriefingHighProfile.xml; Katya; ; That's right. We hand Grishin over to CIA, at minimum they see we're still cooperative.; 
DebriefingHighProfile.xml; Martin; ; If we're lucky, they'll debrief us and allow us to re-enter their service.; 
DebriefingHighProfile.xml; Daniel; ; It may work. But where does that leave you with the FSB?; 
DebriefingHighProfile.xml; Katya; ; I have no interest in working for the FSB anymore. My hope is to make a deal for protection with the CIA, and then... find a better way to make a living.; 
DebriefingHighProfile.xml; Daniel; ; There's a lot of wishful thinking in this plan.; 
DebriefingHighProfile.xml; Katya; ; It's all we've got. If you have a better idea, now is the time to speak up.; 
DebriefingHighProfile.xml; Daniel; ; I guess we better get ready then.; 
DebriefingHighProfile.xml; Katya; ; Right. Let's talk again when we're ready to leave.; 
Radko.xml; Radko; ; Did Josiah bust your balls about the people you've killed?; 
Radko.xml; Player; ; No, he's mostly been concerned with how much evidence we've left behind - and dead men tell no tales, as they say.; 
Radko.xml; Radko; ; Good. The man knows his job. Don't get me wrong, we're not specifically out to kill people, but the mission must come first. It is inevitable in an operation like this that a few people will be in the wrong place at the wrong time.; 
Radko.xml; Player; ; Should I not be concerned with the loss of innocent lives?; 
Radko.xml; Radko; ; Innocence is a philosophical word, I leave such things to others. I am merely relieved to see that you are not afraid to do what needs to be done for the mission.; 
Radko.xml; Player; ; You thought I would not pull the trigger?; 
Radko.xml; Radko; ; I have met a few hardened killers in my time, and you are very different from them.; 
Radko.xml; Player; ; I have tits for one.; Sarcastic.
Radko.xml; Radko; ; That is not what I'm implying. Merely that you are not... damaged.; 
Radko.xml; Player; ; Is that a prerequisite?; 
Radko.xml; Radko; ; No. But it helps, I think.; 
Radko.xml; Radko; ; There you are. I've been meaning to talk to you.; Severe
Radko.xml; Player; ; Should I be worried?; 
Radko.xml; Radko; ; Actually I am the one who is worried about you.; Light stress on "I" and "you"
Radko.xml; Player; ; There are so many reasons to worry about me. Which one did you pick?; 
Radko.xml; Radko; ; It seems that you go out of your way to avoid killing people.; 
Radko.xml; Player; ; Should I not?; A little confused.
Radko.xml; Radko; ; There is nothing wrong with mercy. Only, I worry that you are jeopardizing the mission for the sake of your conscience.; 
Radko.xml; Player; ; It's not like my hands are clean, I just don't kill unless I have to.; 
Radko.xml; Radko; ; But in the heat of the moment, how can you tell which death is necessary and which is not? One day you will hesitate for a moment too long as you calculate the risks, and it will kill you.; 
Radko.xml; ; ; I am not afraid to kill - when necessary.; 
Radko.xml; Radko; ; I hope that you are right. Never let your conscience get in the way of the mission.; 
Radko.xml; Player; ; It's not conscience, it's caution. It's safer in the long run if we keep things clean.; 
Radko.xml; Radko; ; That's a good point. We'll see what the future brings.; 
Radko.xml; ; ; I am a spy, not an assassin.; Defensive
Radko.xml; Radko; ; You must be willing to kill for the sake of the mission. Otherwise, you are not fit for this job.; 
Radko.xml; Player; ; My next mission is a party. You'll have to forgive me if I don't murder all the guests.; 
Radko.xml; Radko; ; Save your sarcasm for the Americans.; 
Radko.xml; Radko; ; There is nothing wrong with mercy. Only, I worry if you are capable of taking a life.; 
Radko.xml; Player; ; I've killed before, Radko.; 
Radko.xml; Radko; ; That is different. The day will come when you are face to face with a human being and you have to pull the trigger for the sake of the mission. nothing personal, just business.; 
Sarah.xml; Sarah; ; Ms. Kozlova.; Terse.
Sarah.xml; Player; ; You seem a little terse today.; 
Sarah.xml; Sarah; ; That wasn't my intention.; It was totally her intention.
Sarah.xml; Player; ; Is there a problem?; Frowning.
Sarah.xml; Sarah; ; I shouldn't say. It's not my place.; Deflective.
Sarah.xml; Player; ; I have very little patience for obtuseness. If something is wrong, I would prefer for you to tell me.; Frowning.
Sarah.xml; Sarah; ; All right. You've killed more people by now than the leaks we're investigating.; 
Sarah.xml; Player; ; Could that be true?; Slightly shocked.
Sarah.xml; Sarah; ; Seven deaths we've connected to our case. You've killed more than that.; 
Sarah.xml; Player; ; You're right...; Contemplative.
Sarah.xml; Sarah; ; I wasn't there. I don't know what it's like to make decisions under such pressure. But please, for your own sake if nothing else, try to pace yourself in the future. Seven lives must weigh a lot on a conscience.; 
Sarah.xml; ; ; I can't control these things. If it's me or them...; 
Sarah.xml; Sarah; ; Just... keep it in mind.; 
Sarah.xml; ; ; I'll do everything I can to prevent further bloodshed.; 
Sarah.xml; Sarah; ; That's all I'm asking. Thank you.; 
Sarah.xml; ; ; Spare me the guilt trip. Our mission cannot be measured in lives.; 
Sarah.xml; Sarah; ; Like I said, it's not my place. I should get back to work.; Annoyed.
Sarah.xml; Sarah; ; Ms. Kozlova, good to have you back.; Friendly.
Sarah.xml; Player; ; You're in a good mood.; Surprised.
Sarah.xml; Sarah; ; I had the opportunity to watch you at work in London. Splendid job. I must especially commend you on your efforts to avoid unnecessary loss of life.; 
Sarah.xml; Player; ; Am I really to be praised for not killing people?; Smiling.
Sarah.xml; Sarah; ; I know it sounds like faint praise, but I now see why Mr. Gray chose you and Martin as our field team, rather than somebody with special forces experience.; 
Sarah.xml; Player; ; I thought that was because the CIA didn't give us any people.; 
Sarah.xml; Sarah; ; What I'm trying to say is... I'm glad you have a conscience. I hope you'll stick to this approach in the future as well.; 
Grishin.xml; Grishin; ; Go on. Richard'll be waiting for you.; 
Grishin.xml; Grishin; ; Glad to see I was right about you.; Smiling.
Grishin.xml; Player; ; I held up my end of the deal.; Smiling.
Grishin.xml; Grishin; ; My associate is already working on Vatkov's files.; Nodding.
Grishin.xml; Player; ; And Baxter?; 
Grishin.xml; Grishin; ; He agreed to meet you upstairs in the guest suite. I'll let him know it's time, and he'll let the guards know you're with him.; 
Grishin.xml; Player; ; Thank you.; 
Grishin.xml; Grishin; ; Dial up the charm, Yulia - you'll need it.; Sly smile.
Grishin.xml; Grishin; ; My associate will let me know when the data starts flowing.; Smiling.
Grishin.xml; Grishin; ; Did you lose your date?; 
Grishin.xml; Player; ; He's off talking business with "the boys". Grown-up stuff, not something a little girl like me would understand.; Facetious.
Grishin.xml; Grishin; ; Is that so? Experience has taught me never to underestimate women like you.; Semi-flirty.
Grishin.xml; Player; ; That is wise, but please don't tell my date this advice. I prefer to be underestimated.; 
Grishin.xml; Grishin; ; (Chuckles) Please pardon my lack of manners. I'm Christopher. Very nice to meet you.; 
Grishin.xml; Player; ; Yulia. Likewise.; Smiling.
Grishin.xml; Grishin; ; And what is your date's name, if I may be so direct? I haven't seen him in these circles before.; 
Grishin.xml; Player; ; Mr. Patel is a businessman from America. Import-export, he says.; Bored.
Grishin.xml; Grishin; ; I've noticed you taking an interest in the English banker, Richard Baxter.; 
Grishin.xml; Player; ; Are you affiliated?; 
Grishin.xml; Grishin; ; We've had dealings. You're after his money?; 
Grishin.xml; Player; ; I was considering it.; 
Grishin.xml; Grishin; ; Maybe I can help you out with that. But I need something in return.; 
Grishin.xml; Player; ; Sounds like we are heading into dangerous territory. I love it.; 
Grishin.xml; Grishin; ; Our host has a very special room in the basement, where he keeps some computers. I've been told there are certain files on those computers that pertain to me and my business.; 
Grishin.xml; ; ; What business might that be?; 
Grishin.xml; Grishin; ; I'm a broker of sorts.; 
Grishin.xml; ; ; And you think I can get you this information?; 
Grishin.xml; Grishin; ; I have a feeling you get whatever you want.; 
Grishin.xml; Player; ; I'm not a computer person. How can I find your files?; 
Grishin.xml; Grishin; ; All I need is for you to plug this into one of the computers. My associate will take it from there.; 
Grishin.xml; Player; ; And in return?; 
Grishin.xml; Grishin; ; I will convince Mr. Baxter to meet you upstairs, in the guest suite.; 
Grishin.xml; Player; ; I will see what I can do.; 
Grishin.xml; Grishin; ; Great. I'll meet you in the winter garden when you're done.; 
Grishin.xml; Martin; ; He must think you're some sort of con artist.; 
Grishin.xml; Player; ; Better than a prostitute. I'll do what he asked, hopefully he'll come through for us.; Under her breath to Martin on the radio.
Grishin.xml; Grishin; ; Evenin'.; Polite.
WenZhi.xml; Player; ; Don't move. Hands above your head. Turn around - slowly.; Authoritative.
WenZhi.xml; WenZhi; ; You're a woman. I didn't expect that.; 
WenZhi.xml; Player; ; A common sentiment.; 
WenZhi.xml; WenZhi; ; You're Whisper, aren't you? The one who's been hunting us. The one who made Baxter disappear in Warsaw.; 
WenZhi.xml; Player; ; That's right. And you're Michelle Chau - or, really, Wen Zhi. Da?; 
WenZhi.xml; WenZhi; ; Are you here to kill me?; 
WenZhi.xml; Player; ; I haven't made up my mind yet. I guess it depends on how hard you make me work for the information I need.; 
WenZhi.xml; WenZhi; ; You want Grishin.; 
WenZhi.xml; Player; ; I want whoever's at the top.; 
WenZhi.xml; WenZhi; ; We're all that's left, he and I. I can't give him up.; 
WenZhi.xml; Player; ; I didn't bring any carrot, Wen. My only option is the stick. I'd like to avoid a mess, but it's up to you.; 
WenZhi.xml; WenZhi; ; You'll have to kill me. I'll never give you Grishin - I owe him that.; 
WenZhi.xml; Player; ; Then we start with your kneecaps and work our way up from --; Gets cuts off
WenZhi.xml; Martin; ; Shit, that was fast. What now? Do we wait for her to wake up?; 
WenZhi.xml; Player; ; No use, she was clearly serious about protecting Grishin. I'm plugging you into her laptop, see what you can find.; Gets cuts off
WenZhi.xml; WenZhi; ; Who are you?; 
WenZhi.xml; Player; ; We'll leave that as a mystery for now.; 
WenZhi.xml; WenZhi; ; Russian? If you're here for the program, you should know I'm only a programmer. I don't have full access.; 
WenZhi.xml; Player; ; I'm not here for Spectrum, Miss Zhi. I'm here about Adrasteia.; 
Josiah.xml; Josiah; ; Coming up with a convincing pretext for you is not a simple matter.; Smiling.
Josiah.xml; Player; ; I'm not surprised to hear you say that.; 
Josiah.xml; Josiah; ; Mr. Mansoor is easy: put him in a suit, give him the sort of title that makes eyelids heavy... asset manager, for instance. But you don't look like you belong anywhere important.; 
Josiah.xml; Player; ; I don't mean to be flippant, Mr. Gray, but you should have seen me when my hair was spiky.; Smiling.
Josiah.xml; Josiah; ; (Chuckles) Yes, well we appreciate your effort to tone it down. Now, what are you here to see me about?; 
Josiah.xml; ; ; Do we have any information at all on Adrasteia?; 
Josiah.xml; Josiah; ; Sarah's team is digging through the archives now and pulling on our contacts within the CIA and the FSB. The only hit we've had so far has been a brief mention buried in a top secret CIA report from the early 80's.; 
Josiah.xml; Player; ; So it's some kind of Cold War thing.; 
Josiah.xml; Josiah; ; It could have been around for longer - it's difficult to say. The report was mainly financial and contained no further information about our targets.; 
Josiah.xml; ; ; I'll start preparing for the next operation.; 
Josiah.xml; Josiah; ; This may be our first real shot at Adrasteia, let's make sure it won't be our last.; 
Josiah.xml; ; ; The Seidel lead seems a little tenuous.; 
Josiah.xml; Josiah; ; Sarah believes we can't afford to ignore any lead, but of course I worry about burn-out. There's a limit to how often you can be deployed before it starts to affect your performance.; 
Josiah.xml; Player; ; So you would prefer me to ignore these opportunity targets?; 
Josiah.xml; Josiah; ; I want you to make the decision for yourself. If you or Symborski start to experience fatigue, focus on the critical missions.; 
Briefing.xml; Sarah; ; The information you uncovered in London has led us to Richard Baxter, a somewhat mysterious and particularly well connected banker. He's officially employed by Catalyst, but apparently he's never set foot in their building and his name appears almost nowhere in their files.; 
Briefing.xml; Sarah; ; When he does appear, it's usually in private correspondence, and these missives make it pretty clear that he is in fact the man controlling the whole money laundering outfit.; 
Briefing.xml; Katya; ; So he is the source of the leaks? He's getting agents killed when they get too close to his operation?; 
Briefing.xml; Sarah; ; There's only one way to find out - find him and ask him. Unfortunately, he's a very difficult man to find. In fact one rather gets the impression that he has extensive experience with tradecraft.; 
Briefing.xml; Daniel; ; He's a spy?; 
Briefing.xml; Sarah; ; Based on the way he covers his tracks, almost certainly. Fortunately Mr. Cibulka is better at finding people than Mr. Baxter is at not being found.; 
Briefing.xml; Katya; ; Hah! You found him, Radko?; Incredulous. Stress on "you".
Briefing.xml; Radko; ; He turned up in Poland. I'm pretty well connected in that neighbourhood. Lot of people who owe me favour.; Shrugging.
Briefing.xml; Sarah; ; Indeed. Mr. Cibulka's connections alerted us that Baxter is attending a party in Warsaw thrown by a Bulgarian drug lord named Veselin Vatkov. The party is on the 7th, and that may be the only window we'll have for quite some time.; 
Briefing.xml; Daniel; ; Who else is on the guest list?; 
Briefing.xml; Sarah; ; Thirty-one people. Mainly Poles and Russians, with a few Germans and Brits bringing the international touch. Most with connections to organised crime.; 
Briefing.xml; Josiah; ; We've managed to get an invitation by leaning on a low ranking member of Vatkov's network. Daniel still has an old CIA identity by the name of Naseer Patel, who we've revived for this operation.; 
Briefing.xml; Katya; ; Is that safe?; 
Briefing.xml; Daniel; ; Naseer is clean. He had nothing to do with the thing in Mexico.; 
Briefing.xml; Josiah; ; Mr. Patel is a Pakistani black market financier looking to establish a connection into Europe. He'll be accompanied by a Russian call girl by the name of Yulia Selezneva.; 
Briefing.xml; Katya; ; My cover is a prostitute?; 
Briefing.xml; Sarah; ; The guest list doesn't leave us much room to be creative. Every woman there has been hired for the occasion - it's that kind of party.; 
Briefing.xml; Josiah; ; I understand this may feel denigrating--; 
Briefing.xml; Katya; ; It's fine. Whatever gets us inside with the fewest questions asked.; "Fuck it" attitude.
Briefing.xml; Josiah; ; Good. Kozlova, you're on point for this one, while Mr. Mansoor will provide the distraction. The objective is to identify Richard Baxter, isolate him, and interrogate him.; 
Briefing.xml; Sarah; ; Our information indicates that Mr. Baxter will stay the night, so you'll be arriving well after dinner, when many of the guests have left - this narrows down the possibilities.; 
Briefing.xml; ; ; All right, let's go to Poland.; 
Briefing.xml; Josiah; ; Your plane leaves tonight. Good luck to all of you.; 
Briefing.xml; ; ; I assume resistance will be pretty low?; 
Briefing.xml; Josiah; ; Vatkov is in organised crime, and these people don't tend to skimp on security. Worse: if you get caught, they're not simply going to try to arrest you.; 
Briefing.xml; Katya; ; Yes I got a good preview in Mexico of what happens - but I can't show up for the party wearing kevlar and a thigh holster...; 
Briefing.xml; Sarah; ; We've procured a very pretty dress for the occasion.; Droll.
Briefing.xml; Katya; ; You've got to be fucking kidding me.; Exhasperated.
Briefing.xml; Martin; ; Come on Kat - it'll be just like the movies.; 
Briefing.xml; ; ; Do we have any idea how this man looks?; 
Briefing.xml; Sarah; ; Unfortunately not. Mr. Baxter is a very enigmatic person.; 
Briefing.xml; Martin; ; Really? We have nothing on him?; 
Briefing.xml; Josiah; ; Someone at the party must know who he is, considering he appears on the guest list as Richard Baxter. Who knows, maybe he'll simply introduce himself.; 
Briefing.xml; Daniel; ; Who'll be canvassing the guests, then? Me or Katya?; 
Briefing.xml; Josiah; ; You'll both have to work the room.; 
PunchingBag.xml; Daniel; ; What martial art is that?; Curious.
PunchingBag.xml; Player; ; Systema Spetznas.; Slightly out of breath.
PunchingBag.xml; Daniel; ; It looks powerful. How long have you practiced?; 
PunchingBag.xml; Player; ; Not long enough. Five years? Since I started working for FSB. But I've done Judo since I was a little girl. In the field, I use a bit of both.; 
PunchingBag.xml; Daniel; ; Most girls are into dolls and ponies.; Winking.
PunchingBag.xml; Player; ; Ponies are nice, but I've always liked boy things.; Smiling.
PunchingBag.xml; Daniel; ; So how does it work, Systema?; 
PunchingBag.xml; Player; ; What, you want me to teach you?; 
PunchingBag.xml; Daniel; ; Just gimme the basics.; 
PunchingBag.xml; Player; ; You have to stay calm and relaxed. Your movement should be fluid and use the other guy's movement against him. You use pressure points to control the other guy's body levers, use rotation to bring him off balance. You strike with your center mass, you attack soft tissue... stuff like that.; 
PunchingBag.xml; Daniel; ; Go for the soft spots, huh? A bit like Krav Maga?; 
PunchingBag.xml; Player; ; Not really. They are both very practical systems with military roots, but Systema is very informal in a way, it varies a lot from teacher to teacher. Both systems are formless, but Krav is more about turning your weaknesses into strengths, I think, while Systema is about overcoming them.; 
PunchingBag.xml; Daniel; ; We should spar some time.; 
PunchingBag.xml; Player; ; I'll be happy to kick your ass at some point.; Winking.
PunchingBag.xml; Daniel; ; Them's fightin' words!; Grinning.
PunchingBag.xml; Player; ; You better believe it.; Grinning.
MartinComputer.xml; Player; ; What is it that you do in that van, exactly? I assume it's complicated, but how do you get into other people's computers?; Curious.
MartinComputer.xml; Martin; ; I don't typically have to get into the computers. I can if I want, but my NSA surveillance suite simplifies a lot of the basic stuff.; Shrugging.
MartinComputer.xml; Martin; ; Actually I can show you if you want. I have a virtual machine for testing that we can use.; 
MartinComputer.xml; ; ; Okay sure, show me.; 
MartinComputer.xml; Martin; ; Cool. Here, have a seat, I'll walk you through it.; 
MartinComputer.xml; Martin; ; This is what I'm looking at most of the time when we're executing. Of course you're not wearing the camera right now, so the feed is empty, and the suite isn't connected to an overhead platform, so there's no map either.; 
MartinComputer.xml; Martin; ; Focus on the network view up to the left. You can maximise it if you want.; 
MartinComputer.xml; Martin; ; The eye icon shows what the system administrator is up to. When you're not doing anything, he'll just be roaming around and doing his thing.; 
MartinComputer.xml; Player; ; Or she.; 
MartinComputer.xml; Martin; ; Uhm, sure. As soon as we modify anything on the network, they'll come check what's going on.; 
MartinComputer.xml; Martin; ; System admins are usually pretty predictable. This is just a simulation, and that's a simple AI that I whipped up, but it's a decent representation of how admins normally behave.; 
MartinComputer.xml; Martin; ; Notice the little triangle icon? That's the node the suite is connected to right now. You'll notice it's just your own computer.; 
MartinComputer.xml; Martin; ; You're not actually on the network yet, you need to breach the firewall first. Fortunately I've written a very clever little program that takes care of that for you. Connect to the firewall by right-clicking on it or using the up arrow key.; 
MartinComputer.xml; Martin; ; Now press Space. The suite will detect what you're trying to do and open my cracking program.; 
MartinComputer.xml; Player; ; "PasswordNuker"?; Amused at the name of a program that opens.
MartinComputer.xml; Martin; ; (Chuckles) Flashy program names and interfaces is kind of a Usenet tradition.; 
MartinComputer.xml; Martin; ; Cool, you're in. Better move your connection before the admin comes down there to check what just happened to the firewall.; 
MartinComputer.xml; Martin; ; If they go to the firewall, they'll find the ports you opened and close them, but your connection to the network will still be intact as long as they don't find your currently active node.; 
MartinComputer.xml; Martin; Now, let's say you want to disable a camera and unlock a door. Go to the camera node in the top right called "testVM underscore CAM1".; Now, let's say you want to disable a camera and unlock a door. Go to the camera node in the top right called "testVM_CAM1".; 
MartinComputer.xml; Martin; ; Now just press Space, and you'll see that camera feed.; 
MartinComputer.xml; Player; ; That's us! I thought this was just a simulation.; Surprised to see her own face on the screen.
MartinComputer.xml; Martin; ; (Chuckles) I gave the VM access to my webcam. Don't worry, it's not connected to the rest of the Kingbridge network.; 
MartinComputer.xml; Martin; ; Now, if you want to cut the feed to the security guys, the suite gives us a convenient button for that. The only problem is that you normally have a pretty short window before they notice the feed's out and sound the alarm.; 
MartinComputer.xml; Martin; ; I've coded in a 6 second timer based on my experience with how long it takes security guys to notice. The great thing is that you can still view the feed while the security guys are blind.; 
MartinComputer.xml; Martin; ; Now, there's a security door in the group to the left, go there now.; 
MartinComputer.xml; Martin; ; When we're cracking security doors, we're actually messing with the keypads, not the doors directly. Right now, the bad guys own this door. Press space to get the pass code.; 
MartinComputer.xml; Player; ; "HashRipper"? Come on, Martin.; Amused.
MartinComputer.xml; Martin; ; It's not that kind of hash, dummy. It's what you call an encrypted password. Anyway, now you have the code, but it has to be punched in before the door is ours. That's where the field operative normally comes in.; 
MartinComputer.xml; Player; ; That's all I'm good for?; Teasing.
MartinComputer.xml; Martin; ; The keypad doesn't actually exist, but if it did and the operative put in the code, we would now be able to open and close the door remotely, again just by pressing Space. And the bad guys can't open or close the door anymore.; 
MartinComputer.xml; Martin; ; Of course, if the admin finds out that this node has been tampered with, they'll reset the code and we have to crack it again if we need it later.; 
MartinComputer.xml; Player; ; Is that it?; 
MartinComputer.xml; Martin; ; Let me just show you one more thing. So, you cracked the door and now the admin is coming to check it out. If you need to stick around, you have to buy yourself some time.; 
MartinComputer.xml; Martin; ; Find the button with the vertical dashed lines in the icon bar on the left. Try and click on that.; 
MartinComputer.xml; Player; ; Oh! What was that?; Something cool happened.
MartinComputer.xml; Martin; ; DDOSFlood. It's one of my own programs. It's not particularly impressive, but it's very useful. Basically I have a botnet that I set up by... well, that doesn't matter. It's a group of computers around the world that I can send commands to.; 
MartinComputer.xml; Martin; ; DDOSFlood tells them all to ping the controller of this network at the same time, repeatedly, which slows everyone else's connections to a crawl. so for about 30 seconds, the admin can't do anything.; 
MartinComputer.xml; Martin; ; I can usually do this 3 times before the admin catches on and disables ping on the whole network.; 
MartinComputer.xml; Martin; ; While they're stunned, connect to that bottleneck node below and we'll set a trap.; 
MartinComputer.xml; Martin; ; Click on that icon with the skull.; 
MartinComputer.xml; Martin; ; Nice, that's a virus. Again, one of mine, but I sometimes find dormant viruses just lying around on the network that I can download and use like this.; 
MartinComputer.xml; Martin; ; Now, if the admin connects through this node on his way up to check on that door, he'll be infected and he'll have to spend some time cleaning his system.; 
MartinComputer.xml; Player; ; That's mean.; More impressed than sympathetic.
MartinComputer.xml; Martin; ; He's a sysadmin, he can take it.; 
MartinComputer.xml; Martin; ; That's it. I have more tools to mess with the admins, but you always have to watch out for them.; 
MartinComputer.xml; Player; ; What if they catch you?; 
MartinComputer.xml; Martin; ; Then I get booted off the system and everything I've changed gets reset. It takes a few seconds to reconnect.; 
MartinComputer.xml; Martin; ; If I've downloaded any valuable intel before I got found, it tends to lose some of its value because the bad guys will do a full audit the next day and find out what I took.; 
MartinComputer.xml; Player; ; This software suite is really clever, you almost don't have to do any work yourself.; Teasing.
MartinComputer.xml; Martin; ; It's all in the preparations, Kat. The programs and viruses always have to be maintained and updated to stay ahead of the security software.; Defensive.
MartinComputer.xml; Player; ; I know, I'm just giving you a hard time. Thanks for showing me how it works.; 
MartinComputer.xml; Martin; ; Any time. But speaking of maintenance, I believe I was just adding a new exploit script to PasswordNuker.; 
MartinComputer.xml; Player; ; I'll leave you to it.; 
MartinComputer.xml; ; ; No that's okay, I think I'll leave that stuff to you.; 
MartinComputer.xml; Martin; ; You sure? Could be good for you to see what I'm up to while you're out there kicking ass.; 
MartinComputer.xml; ; ; Some other time maybe.; 
MartinComputer.xml; ; ; Virtual machine?; 
MartinComputer.xml; Martin; ; A simulation of a computer.; 
Josiah.xml; Josiah; ; How are you holding up?; Concerned.
Josiah.xml; ; ; I'm trying to hold it together. It's difficult.; Emotionally tired.
Josiah.xml; Josiah; ; There are things we can do to make it easier, but our options are limited. Mr. Mansoor might be able to take some of the weight off your shoulders.; Concerned.
Josiah.xml; Player; ; I'll manage, for now. I don't want to dump it all on Daniel. How's the mission going?; Putting on a brave face.
Josiah.xml; Josiah; ; It's going well, thanks to you and Symborski. The analysis department is working on Baxter's book, and I expect we'll have our next confirmed lead within a few weeks.; Concerned.
Josiah.xml; ; ; It's good to be back in the field.; Satisfied.
Josiah.xml; Josiah; ; You enjoy the danger?; Single eyebrow raised.
Josiah.xml; Player; ; I enjoy the challenge.; Shrugging.
Josiah.xml; Josiah; ; There's nothing wrong with that, just be careful what sort of satisfaction you look for in this line of work. It can be a slippery slope.; Concerned.
Josiah.xml; Player; ; How's the mission going?; Changing the subject.
Josiah.xml; ; ; I'm doing okay, all things considered.; Pensive.
Josiah.xml; Josiah; ; Handling the pressure all right?; Concerned.
Josiah.xml; Player; ; It's rough... but I'm very well trained.; Putting on a brave face.
Josiah.xml; Josiah; ; I want you to know, you have nothing to prove to me. If you have any problems...; Concerned.
Intro.xml; Martin; ; Cool, the signal is pretty strong. We should be getting a nice clean feed once the equipment is in place.; Slightly nervous.
Intro.xml; Player; ; This is your first time in the field?; Friendly.
Intro.xml; Martin; ; Uh-huh.; Affirmative.
Intro.xml; Player; ; Don't worry, it's just surveillance. I've done this many times before.; Reassuring.
Intro.xml; Martin; ; I'm not worried.; Trying to hide his nerves.
Intro.xml; Player; ; Good. Let's get started.; Friendly.
Intro.xml; Martin; ; Would you mind activating your Blue Force Tracker?; 
Intro.xml; Player; ; Want to keep an eye on me?; Wry.
Intro.xml; Martin; ; Just in case.; 
Intro.xml; Player; ; Sure.; 
Grishin.xml; Player; ; Hands up. Turn around slowly.; Stern command.
Grishin.xml; Grishin; ; Yulia, wasn't it? I had my suspicions when Richard disappeared after the party, but... this is a surprise.; Surprised. Yulia is the codename Katya gave Grishin in Warsaw.
Grishin.xml; Player; ; Castle, I have positive ID on Christopher Grishin.; To her radio.
Grishin.xml; Grishin; ; Do you work for the Kingbridge Executive?; Compliant, non-threatening.
Grishin.xml; Player; ; How do you know that?; Suspicious.
Grishin.xml; Grishin; ; Spectrum knows everything, and Wen had unfettered access. It shouldn't surprise you that I know of Kingbridge.; 
Grishin.xml; Josiah; ; Ask him what he knows.; 
Grishin.xml; Player; ; What do you know?; 
Grishin.xml; Grishin; ; Just the name.; Dismissive.
Grishin.xml; Josiah; ; If he knows a little, he knows a lot.; Grim.
Grishin.xml; Player; ; We've been on your trail for several months.; 
Grishin.xml; Grishin; ; (Sighs) History repeats.; Weary.
Grishin.xml; FredericBusson; ; Fine work, mademoiselle. We'll take it from here.; Impressed.
DebriefingLowProfile.xml; Josiah; ; Welcome to Kingbridge, Mr. Grishin. I'm glad you could finally join us.; Polite but stern authority.
DebriefingLowProfile.xml; Grishin; ; How did you get me here?; 
DebriefingLowProfile.xml; Josiah; ; That should be the least of your concerns. Understand--; 
DebriefingLowProfile.xml; Grishin; ; Commercial flight?; Cutting Josiah off.
DebriefingLowProfile.xml; Josiah; ; Understand that this interview is not important to us. You have no information that we particularly need.; Dismissive. Letting Grishin know who's in charge.
DebriefingLowProfile.xml; Grishin; ; How long was I under?; Ignoring Josiah.
DebriefingLowProfile.xml; Josiah; ; You're a professional. You know how this works. Playing games will not get you anywhere.; Patient.
DebriefingLowProfile.xml; Grishin; ; Listen to me. CIA knows about you. Top management. I gave them everything.; Serious, exhorting.
DebriefingLowProfile.xml; Josiah; ; I highly doubt that.; Dismissive.
DebriefingLowProfile.xml; Grishin; ; You were quiet, I'll give you that - your field team, the red-haired Russian, very low footprint. But Wen had access thanks to the NSA, through Spectrum. She found you - traces of you, but enough to go on. Enough to scare the hell out of CIA top brass.; Exhorting.
DebriefingLowProfile.xml; Josiah; ; You mean to say--?; Worry creeps into his vioce.
DebriefingLowProfile.xml; Grishin; ;  If they know you have me, they're coming here.; Exhorting.
DebriefingLowProfile.xml; Player; ; The Tantalus protocol...; Mumbling, recalling something she heard a while back.
DebriefingLowProfile.xml; Grishin; ; They could be here any moment. They're probably listening right now, waiting for positive ID.; Exhorting.
DebriefingLowProfile.xml; Grishin; ; Too late.; Sits up, alarmed.
DebriefingLowProfile.xml; Josiah; ; Katya, find a weapon and get upstairs - secure the data from Analysis and the satcom codes from my office. If this location is compromised, we have to evacuate!; Barking orders fast.
DebriefingLowProfile.xml; Player; ; Grishin--; Worried that Grishin will be left defenceless if Tantalus reaches him.
DebriefingLowProfile.xml; Josiah; ; I won't let them kill him. Go!; 
DebriefingLowProfile.xml; Player; ; I have to find Martin!; As much to herself as to Josiah.
DebriefingLowProfile.xml; Josiah; ; Help anyone you can! Go! GO!; 
PaulStevens.xml; PaulStevens; ; Got a new batch of pics from Aspen 20.; 
PaulStevens.xml; OlegZaretsky; ; They show anything?; 
PaulStevens.xml; PaulStevens; ; Oh yeah.; Emphatic.
YuliaVolkova.xml; YuliaVolkova; ; How long until the platform is over the AO?; 
YuliaVolkova.xml; DamienFowler; ; Let me check... 39 minutes.; 
DamienFowler.xml; DamienFowler; ; Know what's missing here?; 
DamienFowler.xml; PaulStevens; ; Enlighten me.; 
DamienFowler.xml; DamienFowler; ; Piranhas.; 
DamienFowler.xml; PaulStevens; ; (Laughs) Holy shit yeah, and, like, a trap door?; 
DamienFowler.xml; DamienFowler; ; Exactly.; 
PaulStevens.xml; PaulStevens; ; Another crash?! I swear to God DARPA needs to hire some competent programmers!; 
PaulStevens.xml; YuliaVolkova; ; Have you tried turning it off and on again?; 
PaulStevens.xml; PaulStevens; ; I'm about to try throwing it in the water!; 
DamienFowler.xml; DamienFowler; ; I can't make heads or tails of this control suite.; 
DamienFowler.xml; OlegZaretsky; ; You can't read Russian?; 
DamienFowler.xml; DamienFowler; ; EVERYTHING in this interface is some obscure abbreviation.; 
DamienFowler.xml; OlegZaretsky; ; We should ask Radko if he can procure a manual.; 
YuliaVolkova.xml; YuliaVolkova; ; Oh! E10 is being jammed again.; Intrigued.
YuliaVolkova.xml; DamienFowler; ; Just noise?; 
YuliaVolkova.xml; YuliaVolkova; ; Classical.; Slightly impressed.
YuliaVolkova.xml; DamienFowler; ; The Chinese?; 
YuliaVolkova.xml; YuliaVolkova; ; Probably.; 
OlegZaretsky.xml; OlegZaretsky; ; That's... weird.; Puzzled.
OlegZaretsky.xml; YuliaVolkova; ; What?; Polite interest.
OlegZaretsky.xml; OlegZaretsky; ; Hm. Nothing.; 
YuliaVolkova.xml; YuliaVolkova; ; Picking up activity on E15.; 
YuliaVolkova.xml; OlegZaretsky; ; The Egyptian one?; 
YuliaVolkova.xml; YuliaVolkova; ; Yeah, Mary Susan Adam.; 
YuliaVolkova.xml; OlegZaretsky; ; Not our problem then.; 
DamienFowler.xml; DamienFowler; ; Mossad approved us to use Ofeq 3.; 
DamienFowler.xml; OlegZaretsky; ; Wow, how did you manage that?; 
DamienFowler.xml; DamienFowler; ; Called in a favour.; 
YuliaVolkova.xml; YuliaVolkova; ; How's that tac map going?; 
YuliaVolkova.xml; PaulStevens; ; Dude, don't get me started.; 
YuliaVolkova.xml; YuliaVolkova; ; Symborski needs it soon.; 
YuliaVolkova.xml; PaulStevens; ; 25 years of education, and this is the job I get.; Frustrated.
YuliaVolkova.xml; YuliaVolkova; ; Life is pain.; Laconic.
VladimirPopovich.xml; Sarah; ; Do you have those transaction records from Luxembourg?; 
VladimirPopovich.xml; VladimirPopovich; ; Yes I'm just looking at the accounts Nadya isolated.; 
VladimirPopovich.xml; Sarah; ; Let me know when you're done.; 
OlegZaretsky.xml; OlegZaretsky; ; That reminds me. I was part of KGB operation to blackmail Indonesian president Sokarno, ever heard of that?; 
OlegZaretsky.xml; ManuelChavez; ; Hmm... sounds familiar, but I can't recall the specifics.; 
OlegZaretsky.xml; OlegZaretsky; ; (Chuckles) Most funny thing I've ever experienced. We set up classic honey trap, no expense spared, we sent several young women disguised as flight attendents. We got it all on tape of course.; 
OlegZaretsky.xml; ManuelChavez; ; Of course.; Smiling.
OlegZaretsky.xml; OlegZaretsky; ; Then we invited him into movie theatre, start playing the video, and we expect him to be frightened, yes? We think he would agree to do anything we tell him so we don't release the video.; 
OlegZaretsky.xml; ManuelChavez; ; But he didn't?; Smiling.
OlegZaretsky.xml; OlegZaretsky; ; He loved it! He thought it was gift from Soviet government! He asked for more copies to bring home so he could show it in movie theatres in Indonesia!; Grinning.
OlegZaretsky.xml; ManuelChavez; ; I don't believe it.; Grinning.
OlegZaretsky.xml; OlegZaretsky; ; Believe it! I was there! We were so confused, we had no idea what to do. He thought his people would be impressed for having sex with Russian girls.; Laughing.
OlegZaretsky.xml; ManuelChavez; ; Incredible.; Shaking his head.
VladimirPopovich.xml; VladimirPopovich; ; Do we know who set up the dead drop in Colombia?; 
VladimirPopovich.xml; Sarah; ; I think they sent somebody down from Cartagena three days ahead.; 
ManuelChavez.xml; ManuelChavez; ; Hey, I wasn't here to watch your last operation, but I've been told you kicked all sorts of ass. I'm sorry if this sounds ignorant, but I was just wondering...; 
ManuelChavez.xml; Player; ; Go on. Ask.; She has an inkling what he's about to ask.
ManuelChavez.xml; ManuelChavez; ; I used to do taekwondo, and I was really into martial arts for a while. I've never seen a lady beat a guy in a fight.; 
ManuelChavez.xml; Player; ; Well, it's a pretty simple equation: in a fair fight, a good big guy will beat a good small guy. That leaves me two options: I can either be better, or I can make sure it's not a fair fight.; 
ManuelChavez.xml; ManuelChavez; ; Which one is it?; 
ManuelChavez.xml; Player; ; When things go according to plan, both.; Smiling.
ManuelChavez.xml; ManuelChavez; ; And when they don't?; Hesitant.
ManuelChavez.xml; Player; ; Knife to the heart or corotid artery.; Grim.
ManuelChavez.xml; ManuelChavez; ; Oh.; Sinks.
ManuelChavez.xml; Sarah; ; Sounds like Umberto got a match on that registration number.; Satisfied.
ManuelChavez.xml; ManuelChavez; ; Umberto?; 
ManuelChavez.xml; Sarah; ; My guy in Madrid.; 
ManuelChavez.xml; ManuelChavez; ; Oh yeah? That's great.; Pleased.
ManuelChavez.xml; ManuelChavez; ; Did Vladimir tell you about his breakthrough in Chechnya?; 
ManuelChavez.xml; Sarah; ; Yes, it sounds very promising.; 
ManuelChavez.xml; ManuelChavez; ; I wonder how long his contact will last.; 
ManuelChavez.xml; Sarah; ; He knows what he's doing.; 
YelenaIvanova.xml; YelenaIvanova; ; Hey Radko, those fuses - were they in E or F?; 
YelenaIvanova.xml; Radko; ; Why don't you look in the manifest?; Annoyed.
YelenaIvanova.xml; YelenaIvanova; ; It's easier to ask you.; Cheeky.
YelenaIvanova.xml; Radko; ; F.; Wry smile.
YelenaIvanova.xml; YelenaIvanova; ; We're almost out of lubricant.; 
YelenaIvanova.xml; Radko; ; I'll tell René to bring some tomorrow.; 
ManuelChavez.xml; ManuelChavez; ; Finally beat your score at the range last night.; Pleased with himself.
ManuelChavez.xml; Radko; ; Really? Guess I'll have to up my game.; Unimpressed.
ManuelChavez.xml; ManuelChavez; ; Mansoor handed me my ass at pool yesterday.; 
ManuelChavez.xml; VladimirPopovich; ; Yes Giannis told me. Said you got crushed.; 
ManuelChavez.xml; ManuelChavez; ; He was pretending to be bad at it at first, then he took me for five hundred bucks!; 
ManuelChavez.xml; VladimirPopovich; ; Maybe that'll teach you not to play for money.; 
PaulStevens.xml; PaulStevens; ; ...and you just KNOW she'd be a freak in bed--; 
PaulStevens.xml; DamienFowler; ; Shhh!; She's standing right behind you!
PaulStevens.xml; DamienFowler; ; I'm going back for my kid's birthday next Thursday.; Happy.
PaulStevens.xml; PaulStevens; ; Gray signed off on it?; 
PaulStevens.xml; DamienFowler; ; Yeah. Kid's been going on about this Quake game for months.; 
PaulStevens.xml; PaulStevens; ; Did you get it?; 
PaulStevens.xml; DamienFowler; ; I got him the game, AND a new computer to run it.; Pleased with himself.
PaulStevens.xml; PaulStevens; ; Dad of the year.; Grinning.
PaulStevens.xml; DamienFowler; ; Gotta love that deployment bonus.; 
YelenaIvanova.xml; YelenaIvanova; ; Any progress with Alexandra?; 
YelenaIvanova.xml; Reinhardt; ; She's got a boyfriend.; Disappointed.
YelenaIvanova.xml; YelenaIvanova; ; Ouch.; Sympathetic.
YelenaIvanova.xml; Reinhardt; ; She's out of my league anyway.; Sad.
Martin.xml; Martin; ; I wanted to help the EFF's fight for crypto, but I was working for FBI at the time. And I really liked that job.; 
Martin.xml; Martin; ; People don't even realise this is happening. If it ever got out, I can only imagine the absolute shitstorm.; 
Martin.xml; Martin; ; Pretty sure me telling you all this constitutes treason, by the way. So I'd appreciate it if you keep it to yourself.; 
Martin.xml; Martin; ; Let me ask you a question. Do you have anything to hide?; Rhetorical question. Emphasis on the first "you".
Martin.xml; Player; ; Of course I do. I'm a spy.; Wry smile.
Martin.xml; Martin; ; Right, but imagine you weren't. You're just a regular woman working as an engineer for some electrical company in Moscow.; 
Martin.xml; Martin; ; Your finances are in order, you're faithful to your boyfriend, you're good at your job, and you pay for all your entertainment. Why should you give a damn about who reads your emails? ; 
Martin.xml; Player; I grew up with the KGB, I can think of a few reasons. For example, if I'm not a huge fan of the government I might one day find myself in a dark concrete room beneath Лубянская площадь.; I grew up with the KGB, I can think of a few reasons. For example, if I'm not a huge fan of the government I might one day find myself in a dark concrete room beneath Lubyanskaya ploshchad.; 
Martin.xml; Martin; ; Point taken, but then what if you live in America where we don't throw people in jail for not agreeing with the government.; 
Martin.xml; Player; ; Don't kid yourself.; Raises an eyebrow.
Martin.xml; Martin; ; Work with me here.; Grinning.
Martin.xml; Player; ; All right. I have nothing to hide and nothing to fear. Nothing I do can be used against me, right?; 
Martin.xml; Martin; ; Right. You don't need data security. Do you?; Still rhetorical.
Martin.xml; Player; ; What about my boss?; 
Martin.xml; Martin; ; What about him?; Leading her on.
Martin.xml; Player; ; Maybe he's having an affair. Maybe he owes a lot of taxes. Or what about my boyfriend's boss? Or the mayor of my town, or the police chief? Or the President?; 
Martin.xml; Martin; ; Exactly.; Satisfied.
Martin.xml; Player; ; All these people have some sort of power over my life, and I trust them - or, well, I should be able to trust them - to be good and fair and do their jobs according to public interest.; 
Martin.xml; Player; ; If the NSA or the FBI have a lot of dirt on all of them, how do I know they're acting in public interest? Maybe they're acting in the interest of the NSA instead.; 
Martin.xml; Martin; ; Exactly! We're supposed to live in a democracy, which means the people control the government, not the intelligence agencies.; 
Martin.xml; Martin; ; It's like something out a conspiracy theorist's worst nightmare, except instead of the government watching you through your TV, your computer is spying on you for the government!; 
Martin.xml; Player; ; So what do you make of Spectrum?; 
Martin.xml; Martin; ; It's impressive stuff.; 
Martin.xml; Player; ; Morally speaking, I mean.; Wry.
Martin.xml; Martin; ; I'm not surprised the NSA is funding a project like that. NSA, FBI, and other alphabet agencies have been working to undermine data security and encryption for a long time.; 
Martin.xml; Player; ; Shouldn't they be supporting better data security?; 
Martin.xml; Martin; ; (Snorts) Any data not under their control is potential enemy communication. Listen, two years ago we got a law in the US called the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act.; 
Martin.xml; Martin; ; This was after a long, hard fight about whether encryption should be legal - the Crypto Wars.; 
Martin.xml; Martin; ; Now, organisations like the Electronic Frontiers Foundation won that fight, and the law states that telecom companies do not have to help the government decrypt their customers' data. ; 
Martin.xml; Martin; ; As you saw in California though, the NSA doesn't give a shit. They went ahead and started sabotaging everyone's security anyway. Projects like Spectrum is the com-int side of that, but they use hum-int too.; 
Martin.xml; Player; ; They have operatives inside communication corporations?; 
Martin.xml; Martin; ; I, uh, probably shouldn't be telling an FSB officer about that...; Embarrassed.
Martin.xml; ; ; You're right, I don't want to get you into trouble.; 
Martin.xml; Martin; ; You'll find out eventually. This will all get out one day. I hope.; 
Martin.xml; ; ; You know you can trust me. I have no loyalty to FSB.; Surprised.
Martin.xml; Martin; ; Well... I guess you have access to more dangerous information already. So yes: software companies and open-source organisations have been infiltrated by the NSA.; 
Martin.xml; Martin; ; Mass-surveillance and super-computer decryption can only get you so far, what you really want is a backdoor into every available security protocol.; 
Martin.xml; Player; ; You had access to these projects?; 
Martin.xml; Martin; ; Uh-huh.; Affirmative.
Martin.xml; Player; ; This is insane. If the NSA is sneaking back doors into security systems, those back doors will be available to anyone. Not just Russian or Chinese intelligence, but scammers and con artists and gangsters...; Disbelief.
Martin.xml; Martin; ; Any security flaw becomes endemic. You can't design a piece of software to be completely and utterly secure except for this one little shortcut you've left for yourself.; 
Martin.xml; Martin; ; Encryption is either one hundred percent secure, or zero percent secure. The NSA and groups like it have sabotaged the basic foundations of the World Wide Web.; 
Martin.xml; Player; ; This is infuriating! Why aren't you angry?!; 
Martin.xml; Martin; ; I am angry. I just don't know what to do about it.; Defeated.
StefciaWojciechowska.xml; StefciaWojciechowska; ; Watch yourself honey. This is not a good place for a girl with attitude.; Jaded.
StefciaWojciechowska.xml; StefciaWojciechowska; ; Rich fucking pigs the lot of them. Useless waste of space.; Disgusted.
StefciaWojciechowska.xml; StefciaWojciechowska; ; You're a pretty little thing. Keep your mouth shut and you'll go over well in there.; Cynical.
CelinaBorkowska.xml; CelinaBorkowska; ; Go find your own man, this one is taken.; Annoyed.
CelinaBorkowska.xml; CelinaBorkowska; ; Why are you still here? ; Annoyed.
CelinaBorkowska.xml; CelinaBorkowska; ; Nice dress.; Disdainful and sarcastic.
PartyGuardUpstairs.xml; PartyGuardUpstairs; ; Remember: stay out of the family rooms.; 
PartyGuardUpstairs.xml; Player; ; But winter's bite is colder still.; Smug.
PartyGuardUpstairs.xml; PartyGuardUpstairs; ; So you got the big man to bite, huh? I hope his wife never finds out what really happens at these parties.; Surprised.
PartyGuardUpstairs.xml; PartyGuardUpstairs; ; The guest suite is on the right. Don't stray into the family rooms, or we will fuck you up. Understood?; 
PartyGuardUpstairs.xml; Player; ; All right...; Uncomfortable.
PartyGuardUpstairs.xml; PartyGuardUpstairs; ; Get lost, girl. You're not fooling anyone.; Menacing.
PartyGuardUpstairs.xml; Player; ; Mr. Vatkov has asked me to wait for him upstairs.; Tentative.
PartyGuardUpstairs.xml; PartyGuardUpstairs; ; (Sighs) The Northern wind is brisk this time of year.; Disgruntled.
PartyGuardUpstairs.xml; Player; ; Uhm... what?; Confused.
PartyGuardUpstairs.xml; PartyGuardUpstairs; ; Please stay downstairs unless Mr. Vatkov invites you up, ma'am.; Polite.
PartyGuardUpstairs.xml; PartyGuardUpstairs; ; The situation hasn't changed, miss. No access upstairs except with Vatkov's permission.; Polite.
PartyGuardUpstairs.xml; PartyGuardUpstairs; ; The second floor is off limits to guests except by invitation from Mr. Vatkov.; Polite.
JerzyKwiatkowski.xml; JerzyKwiatkowski; ; Who brought you here? Go find him and leave us alone.; Patronising.
JerzyKwiatkowski.xml; JerzyKwiatkowski; ; Don't stick your nose in men's business if you know what's good for you.; Patronising and threatening.
JerzyKwiatkowski.xml; JerzyKwiatkowski; ; What are you looking at? Stupid girl.; Disdainful.
MuratVoronov.xml; MuratVoronov; ; Ask the staff if you need to find something.; Dismissive.
MuratVoronov.xml; MuratVoronov; ; You look a little lost.; Trying to send a hint for Katya to go away.
MuratVoronov.xml; MuratVoronov; ; Are you looking for someone?; Annoyed.
SpencerCoates.xml; SpencerCoates; ; And those legs...; Lecherous.
SpencerCoates.xml; SpencerCoates; ; (Wolf whistle); 
SpencerCoates.xml; SpencerCoates; ; Love the dress, my dear. It would look great on my bedroom floor.; Lecherous.
RajmundNowak.xml; RajmundNowak; ; I'm sure a party like this is profitable for someone like you.; Sneering.
RajmundNowak.xml; RajmundNowak; ; Can I help you with anything?; Polite but maybe a little sneering.
RajmundNowak.xml; RajmundNowak; ; Madam.; Polite but bored.
ApolinaryCzarnecki.xml; ApolinaryCzarnecki; ; Are you looking for the toilets?; Helpful.
ApolinaryCzarnecki.xml; ApolinaryCzarnecki; ; Please, guests should stay out of the kitchen.; Polite but stern.
ApolinaryCzarnecki.xml; ApolinaryCzarnecki; ; Will you please leave the kitchen, miss?; Stern.
TortureOverheard.xml; Daniel; ; (Groans) I've told you everything I know...; Preceded by the sound of a punch.
TortureOverheard.xml; Esteban; ; You've fed me nothing but bullshit for days. Surely, at some point you must run out of bullshit, but I will never run out of ways to hurt you.; Preceded by the sound of a hard slap.
TortureOverheard.xml; Daniel; ; (Screams) You sick fuck! Are you enjoying this?!; 
TortureOverheard.xml; Esteban; ; Of course not. But there are things I need to know about your infiltration of our network, and unfortunately for you, we're running short on time.; 
TortureOverheard.xml; Daniel; ; (Spits blood) ...what?; Dazed.
TortureOverheard.xml; Esteban; ; We've been careful not to harm your health until now.; 
TortureOverheard.xml; Daniel; ; Fuck you.; Calling out Esteban on his bullshit.
TortureOverheard.xml; Esteban; ; Oh, but we have. We've been keeping you alive under the assumption that we would have all the time in the world to make you talk. But this is no longer the case. So now we will try something else.; 
TortureOverheard.xml; Daniel; ; Jesus Christ...; Esteban opens a case of really nasty looking tools.
TortureOverheard.xml; Esteban; ; Not exactly.; Dead pan.
TortureOverheard.xml; Daniel; ; (Anguished scream); 
ThugsOverheard.xml; Thug01; ; Tough bastard.; Quietly impressed.
ThugsOverheard.xml; Thug02; ; Esteban could crack him if we had the time.; Shrugging.
ThugsOverheard.xml; Thug01; ; When you put it that way, I guess the raid is lucky for him. Now he gets a quick death instead.; 
ThugsOverheard.xml; Thug02; ; Eh, we won't give up that easily. We still have all night to try and get something out of the poor bastard.; 
ThugsOverheard.xml; Thug01; ; And we don't have to try to keep him alive anymore. That'll simplify things.; 
ThugsOverheard.xml; Player; ; Did you hear that?; Whispering to Martin on the radio.
ThugsOverheard.xml; Martin; ; Yeah, doesn't sound good.; Worried.
ThugsOverheard.xml; Player; ; Our man won't be alive for the raid tomorrow.; Whispering.
ThugsOverheard.xml; Martin; ; Maybe if we call the cops on these guys...; 
ThugsOverheard.xml; Player; ; They ARE the cops. We gotta get him out of there.; Whispering.
ThugsOverheard.xml; Martin; ; We're just here to set up eyes and ears.; Trepidacious.
ThugsOverheard.xml; Player; ; Martin, listen. Daniel Mansoor will be killed unless we stop it.; Determined.
ThugsOverheard.xml; Martin; ; You can't go in, we're not prepared!; 
ThugsOverheard.xml; Player; ; We have to do something. Will you help me?; 
ThugsOverheard.xml; Martin; ; God damnit... all right. Be careful.; Swears under his breath.
WarehouseAntechamber.xml; Player; ; I'm inside. The door is locked. Keypad.; Whispering.
WarehouseAntechamber.xml; Martin; ; Is there a computer?; 
WarehouseAntechamber.xml; Player; ; Yes.; Whispering.
WarehouseAntechamber.xml; Martin; ; Plug me in. I'll get the door for you.; 
Receptionist.xml; Receptionist; ; Good evening ma'am. How can I help you?; Polite.
Receptionist.xml; Player; ; I'm here for a job interview. Senior quality assurance engineer?; Hesitant.
Receptionist.xml; Receptionist; ; Sure, may I ask who booked the appointment for you?; 
Receptionist.xml; ; ; Douglas Bryant.; 
Receptionist.xml; Receptionist; ; Uhm... I'm sorry, it doesn't look like we have anyone here by that name.; 
Receptionist.xml; Player; ; Oh. There must be some kind of mistake.; Confused.
Receptionist.xml; Receptionist; ; I'm afraid there's nothing further I can do. I'll have to ask you to come back tomorrow during normal business hours, and we'll see if we can help you.; Polite but stern.
Receptionist.xml; Receptionist; ; Mr. Bryant has already clocked out for the day. Are you sure you have the right time?; 
Receptionist.xml; Player; ; Well, now I'm starting to wonder. Could you call his office and see if he's really left?; Hesitant.
Receptionist.xml; Receptionist; ; Of course. Who shall I say it is?; Hesitates, thinking it's futile, but decides to be courteous.
Receptionist.xml; Player; ; Yulia Selezneva.; 
Receptionist.xml; Receptionist; ; Hold on please.; Dials a number.
Receptionist.xml; Martin; ; Bryant speaking.; Tired.
Receptionist.xml; Receptionist; ; Oh, hello Mr. Bryant.; Surprised.
Receptionist.xml; Martin; ; What's up?; Tired.
Receptionist.xml; Receptionist; ; I have a Yulia Selezneva here to see you for a job interview?; Surprised.
Receptionist.xml; Martin; ; Oh damn, I totally forgot. Thank God for this stupid quarterly report. Send her up, please.; Embarrassed.
Receptionist.xml; Receptionist; ; Of course, thank you.; Pleased.
Receptionist.xml; Receptionist; ; Sorry about the confusion Ms. Selezneva. You can go right up now.; Friendly.
Receptionist.xml; Player; ; No problem at all.; Relieved.
Receptionist.xml; Martin; ; Judd speaking.; Tired.
Receptionist.xml; Receptionist; ; Oh, hello Mr. Judd.; Surprised.
Receptionist.xml; Martin; ; Kelly speaking.; Tired.
Receptionist.xml; Receptionist; ; Oh, hello Mr. Kelly.; Surprised.
Receptionist.xml; Receptionist; ; No one's picking up...; Apologetic.
Receptionist.xml; Player; ; Give it a moment more please.; Imploring.
Receptionist.xml; Receptionist; ; I'm really sorry, Ms. Selezneva, it seems he has left for the day. If you call again tomorrow during normal business hours, we can get your appointment rebooked?; Hangs up.
Receptionist.xml; Player; ; There must have been a misunderstanding.; Disappointed.
Receptionist.xml; Receptionist; ; Sorry. Would you like me to call you a taxi?; Professionally sympathetic.
Receptionist.xml; Player; ; No no, thank you. Bye.; Disappointed.
Receptionist.xml; ; ; Larry Kelly.; 
Receptionist.xml; Receptionist; ; Mr. Kelly has already clocked out for the day. Are you sure you have the right time?; 
Receptionist.xml; ; ; Chris Judd.; 
Receptionist.xml; Receptionist; ; Mr. Judd has already clocked out for the day. Are you sure you have the right time?; 
Receptionist.xml; ; ; What do you mean? I just got a call asking me to show up at this time and place for my interview.; Speak somewhat slowly, she's trying to stall.
Receptionist.xml; Receptionist; ; Of course, sorry - and who gave you the call?; 
Receptionist.xml; ; ; Your quality assurance lead. It was the same person who put up the job post, I think.; Still stalling...
Receptionist.xml; Receptionist; ; Do you remember the name?; Hint of annoyance.
Receptionist.xml; ; ; Why...? Do you have more than one quality assurance lead? My interview was scheduled for 5 pm, I'm already running late.; Still stalling...
Receptionist.xml; Receptionist; ; I just need to verify your appointment in our scheduling system, ma'am. Can you recall the name of the person you talked to?; Annoyed but summoning her professional patience.
IntroBanter.xml; Daniel; ; You may not feel it, but you look fantastic in that dress.; 
IntroBanter.xml; Player; ; Sarah has good taste in fashion, I admit. But these heels are killing me.; Begrudging.
IntroBanter.xml; Daniel; ; Maybe if you tried not walking like you're wearing combat boots...; Good-natured constructive criticism.
IntroBanter.xml; Player; ; It's not exactly fair that if you want to dress fancy as hell, you can still run without breaking your ankles.; Crooked grin. Stress on first "you".
IntroBanter.xml; Martin; ; All right guys, get your game faces on.; Professional.
XeniaRozhkova.xml; XeniaRozhkova; ; What...? I recognise you! Hey, that woman is a spy! She's FSB, they sent her here to spy on us!; 
XeniaRozhkova.xml; XeniaRozhkova; ; Hey, I know you. No fucking way! You treacherous bitch, you sold my brother out to the FSB!; 
XeniaRozhkova.xml; XeniaRozhkova; ; Hey... you! Red dress! You fucking traitor! Did FSB send you here?! You want to kill me like you killed Mikhail?!; 
RadioXeniaSpotted.xml; Player; ; Shit!; Cursing under her breath.
RadioXeniaSpotted.xml; Martin; ; What's wrong?; Concerned.
RadioXeniaSpotted.xml; Player; ; I know that woman. And she knows me!; 
RadioXeniaSpotted.xml; Martin; ; That's impossible, we background checked everyone.; 
RadioXeniaSpotted.xml; Player; ; Well we fucked it up, that's Xenia Rozhkova! She's former Black Sickle.; 
RadioXeniaSpotted.xml; Martin; ; Are you sure? That'd be a hell of a coincidence.; 
RadioXeniaSpotted.xml; Player; ; I have no idea what she's doing here, but she can blow my cover.; 
RadioXeniaSpotted.xml; Martin; ; You better not let her ID you then.; 
RadioXeniaSpotted.xml; Player; ; I'll try to stay out of her way. Keep an eye on her, let me know what she's up to.; 
DanielAndVatkov.xml; Daniel; ; Mr. Vatkov, here you are. Am I too late for the game?; Friendly.
DanielAndVatkov.xml; VeselinVatkov; ; Hm? I don't think we've been introduced.; Slightly irritated at the interruption.
DanielAndVatkov.xml; Daniel; ; Of course, sorry - I've lived too long in the States. You pick up a certain disregard for protocol. I'm Naseer Patel.; Slightly glib.
DanielAndVatkov.xml; VeselinVatkov; ; Oh, yes, Mr. Patel. I liked your proposition - very bold.; Flips from irritated to friendly.
DanielAndVatkov.xml; Daniel; ; Perhaps you would discuss the details over that game you promised me? At your convenience, of course.; Slightly glib.
DanielAndVatkov.xml; VeselinVatkov; ; Now is as good a time as any.; Shrugging.
DanielAndVatkov.xml; VeselinVatkov; ; If you'll excuse me, my friend?; Apologetic.
DanielAndVatkov.xml; RichardBaxter; ; Will you permit me to join you?; Idle curiosity.
DanielAndVatkov.xml; VeselinVatkov; ; Perhaps later, if the first few hands go well.; Apologetic.
DanielAndVatkov.xml; RichardBaxter; ; Ah, indeed. Good luck.; Shrugging.
Briefing.xml; Martin; ; Well, they haven't found us yet.; Semi-surprised at still being alive.
Briefing.xml; Player; ; It's only a matter of time. Do we have Grishin?; Grim and businesslike.
Briefing.xml; Martin; ; Yes. We're going to a place called Echo Hotel.; 
Briefing.xml; Martin; ; KS Global is establishing a special operations group. They're being trained out of a compound in the southern Ural mountains in Russia. The place is a former KGB signal station with the NATO designation EH-16, or Echo Hotel.; 
Briefing.xml; Martin; ; According to the Paris files, Grishin is working as a special ops consultant for KS Global. I've done some good old-fashioned World Wide Web-enabled cracking and discovered that Grishin is heading up the training programme.; 
Briefing.xml; Daniel; ; Can we be sure he's still there?; 
Briefing.xml; Martin; ; He's there. I've gained access to very recent e-mail correspondence that confirms it.; 
Briefing.xml; Player; ; We should go as soon as possible.; 
Briefing.xml; Daniel; ; Katya... are you sure you want to do this? I mean... the odds are not good.; 
Briefing.xml; Martin; ; I have to agree with the big lug. You'd have to be off your rocker to go in there - the work we did for Kingbridge was crazy, but at least we had support. We're on our own now, and you want to raid a mercenary compound in the Ural mountains?; 
Briefing.xml; Player; ; I'm not going to give up. Not now. I'm going to get Grishin, or... die trying.; 
Briefing.xml; Player; ; Guys... I don't want to do this alone, but if you want to leave, I understand. This is crazy, I know. I just can't let Grishin get away after all this.; Solemn.
Briefing.xml; Martin; ; If you go, I go.; 
Briefing.xml; Daniel; ; Yeah. What's the plan?; 
Briefing.xml; Player; ; Martin, can you get Naseer Patel a spot on the KS spec ops program?; 
Briefing.xml; Martin; ; That identity has too much baggage by now, but it's been a while since I last created a complete identity from scratch. It's about time I brush up on my techniques.; 
Briefing.xml; Daniel; ; Good, we'll need a man on the inside.; 
Briefing.xml; Player; ; We'll give you a few days to get situated, then we go. We'll need a diversion to pull the majority of the mercs away - I'm thinking... something involving a large volume of plastique.; 
Briefing.xml; Daniel; ; I'll come up with something.; 
Briefing.xml; Player; ; With most of the security gone, I'll slip in and find Grishin. Extracting him will be a challenge, though. Any suggestions?; 
Briefing.xml; Martin; ; I think I can get us a helicopter.; 
Briefing.xml; Player; ; What? How?; Surprised, a bit skeptical.
Briefing.xml; Martin; ; I know a guy.; Shrugging.
Briefing.xml; Player; ; All right, I'll take it.; Smiling.
Briefing.xml; Player; ; Danny, you fly out tomorrow. We'll rendezvous in three days and bring your documents.; 
Briefing.xml; Martin; ; Good luck, man.; Sincere.
Briefing.xml; Daniel; ; Yeah, you too.; Grinning.
Radko.xml; Radko; ; I have something to show you.; 
Radko.xml; Player; ; A new toy to play with?; Smiling.
Radko.xml; Radko; ; Not a toy - not this one. In fact, I'm hoping you won't like it, but the choice is yours.; Frowning.
Radko.xml; Player; ; What is it?; Frowning.
Radko.xml; Radko; ; Novichok-7 gas grenades. Nerve agent.; 
Radko.xml; Player; ; Holy shit, Radko. Where did you get this?; Vaguely horrified.
Radko.xml; Radko; ; It's Soviet surplus from an old friend in the GRU. He's selling to the highest bidder, and I thought that might as well be us. This is just a smuggled sample, there's a whole crate of these if we can pay him.; 
Radko.xml; Player; ; It's lethal, I assume.; Morbidly curious.
Radko.xml; Radko; ; Oh yes. They're gruesome, and forbidden in warfare by the Geneva Protocol and several other treaties.; 
Radko.xml; Radko; ; When the Chemical Weapons Convention comes into effect next April, it will also be illegal to manufacture and stockpile.; 
Radko.xml; Player; ; I assume it's a very dependable way to kill people silently.; Probing to figure out how sincere Radko's apprehension is.
Radko.xml; Radko; ; Yes - it's fast enough that the victim has no time to call for help. It causes immediate involuntary contraction of all muscles, paralyzing the victim. Their lungs and their heart will stop working, and they die.; 
Radko.xml; Player; ; That must be incredibly painful.; Whincing.
Radko.xml; Radko; ; I believe so. It's a horrendous way to kill a man. But - as I said - the choice is yours. If you want me to buy the weapons, assign the funds and I will finalise the deal.; Nods.
Radko.xml; Radko; ; Even if we never use them, and I pray you won't... they're safer with us than with my friend.
; 
Radko.xml; Radko; ; What do you know about depleted uranium?; Conspiratorial smile.
Radko.xml; Player; ; Seriously, Radko? Am I snooping around or am I going to war?; 
Radko.xml; Radko; ; I got a good lead on a few cases of uranium rounds from a man I know in Iraq.; 
Radko.xml; Player; ; You're really just in this to satisfy some compulsive hoarding disorder, aren't you? All right, what can uranium do that normal bullets can't?; Humouring him.
Radko.xml; Radko; ; It's self-sharpening and incendiary. That means it's just as good against armoured targets as AP rounds and just as damaging against unarmoured targets as hollow-point.; 
Radko.xml; Player; ; Best of both worlds, huh? Is it safe?; Slightly apprehensive.
Radko.xml; Radko; ; Not to the target! I mean, yeah, prolonged exposure can be unhealthy, but just be careful, and maybe hold your breath while you fire, and you should be fine.; Joking around.
Radko.xml; Player; ; Any other drawbacks I should be aware of?; 
Radko.xml; Radko; ; It's traceable, that's the main disadvantage. If some people get shot with ball or AP, the perpetrator could be anybody. Somebody gets shot with depleted uranium, it narrows down the list of suspects.; 
Radko.xml; Player; ; I'll think about it.; 
Radko.xml; Radko; ; Just assign the funds if you want me to pick up a few cases.; 
Debriefing.xml; Josiah; ; Welcome back, and congratulations on your third successful operation.; Pleased.
Debriefing.xml; Martin; ; Congrats on surviving so far, you mean?; Cynical.
Debriefing.xml; Player; ; How the hell did you not manage to ID Xenia?; Shaking her head.
Debriefing.xml; Sarah; ; The sister of a member of a defunct Russian extremist group now working as a call girl. We should have caught it, and I'm sorry we didn't, but you must admit this was a particularly tricky one.; Sincerely regretful, but appealing to Katya's reason.
Debriefing.xml; Daniel; ; We don't know that she would've blown your cover if she'd spotted you.; Diplomatic.
Debriefing.xml; Player; ; She would have. Trust me.; Eyes narrow.
Debriefing.xml; Sarah; ; Because you killed her brother?; Dead pan.
Debriefing.xml; Martin; ; What?!; Laughing surprised.
Debriefing.xml; Player; ; Yes, because of that.; Completely dead-pan.
Debriefing.xml; Martin; ; You have to tell that story at some point.; 
Debriefing.xml; Josiah; ; (Clears throat) Baxter's black book should keep the analysts occupied for a few weeks.; Forcing the conversation back on-topic.
Debriefing.xml; Sarah; ; You didn't have to kill Baxter, you know. Scotland Yard would have been happy to take him.; Restrained indignation.
Debriefing.xml; Player; ; This was safer.; 
Debriefing.xml; Josiah; ; If your concern is op-sec, perhaps you shouldn't leave so much evidence behind in the future.; Slightly admonishing.
Debriefing.xml; ; ; A little noise may be a good thing.; 
Debriefing.xml; Josiah; ; Until we know more about our targets, that kind of gambit is too risky. We don't know how they'll respond to the threat we pose.; Frowning.
Debriefing.xml; Daniel; ; Will that be all, sir?; Businesslike.
Debriefing.xml; Josiah; ; While the analysis department chews through Baxter's book, we should all prepare for the next operation. As always, don't hesitate to see me if you have any concerns about the mission or our operations. ; 
Debriefing.xml; ; ; I tried. I will try harder next time.; Severe.
Debriefing.xml; Josiah; ; Your concern for op-sec is admirable. You left almost no evidence in Warsaw that could be traced back to us.; Praising.
Debriefing.xml; Player; ; There's no substitute for the element of surprise.; Nodding.
Debriefing.xml; Sarah; ; Scotland Yard was quite surprised when we delivered Baxter to them. They should have no trouble getting a conviction with the evidence you got in London.; Amused.
Debriefing.xml; Player; ; Killing Baxter wouldn't have stopped the leaks. We need his boss.; 
Debriefing.xml; Josiah; ; You're right, and that's why you should watch your footprint a bit more - we don't want our target to know we're coming.; Slightly admonishing.
Debriefing.xml; Josiah; ; You're right, and that's why I'm very happy with how little evidence you left behind in Warsaw - we don't want our target to know we're coming.; Praising.
Briefing.xml; Josiah; ; We've identified Grishin. Are you all sitting down? Good.; Pause for effect between each sentence.
Briefing.xml; Player; ; You're fucking kidding me.; Shocked.
Briefing.xml; Sarah; ; Meet Christopher Grishin. US Navy SEAL. Almost certainly former CIA based on the authorization codes his navy records were buried under. Completely off the grid for the past 20 years.; 
Briefing.xml; Martin; ; Christopher, the guy who helped us in Warsaw?; Disbelief.
Briefing.xml; Player; ; That's him! He was right under our nose! We could have grabbed him at the party!; Disbelief.
Briefing.xml; Sarah; ; Yes, if we had known then what we know now, but that knowledge was hard earned.; 
Briefing.xml; Martin; ; If he was working with Baxter, why would he help Katya corner him?; Confused.
Briefing.xml; Player; ; You said it yourself, he thought I was just some hustler. He knew Baxter was gay, and he thought I was just a honey pot.; 
Briefing.xml; Daniel; ; Do we have his location?; 
Briefing.xml; Sarah; ; Yes! Grishin is an incredibly hard target, but we managed it - we've tracked him to a safehouse in Paris.; Rather pleased with herself.
Briefing.xml; Josiah; ; Grishin's hideout demonstrates a certain sense of the dramatic. He's using an old estate abandoned when its Jewish owners fled the nazis.; 
Briefing.xml; Josiah; ; We've had eyes on it for the past two weeks, and we've confirmed that it's still active. Grishin has tickets to Paris this weekend. He'll be there. This is actionable intelligence.; 
Briefing.xml; Daniel; ; I'll grab him.; Determined.
Briefing.xml; Josiah; ; No, I need you elsewhere.; 
Briefing.xml; Daniel; ; What could possibly be more important than Grishin?!; Annoyed.
Briefing.xml; Josiah; ; We can't bet it all on this lead. It's not a question of importance, your skill set is more suited for another operation. Katya and Martin will handle Paris.; Authoritative.
Briefing.xml; Daniel; ; Grishin sounds like a very dangerous person...; 
Briefing.xml; Josiah; ; Grishin has received the best training the US government can provide, and he is highly experienced. Do not attempt to neutralize him yourself. Find him, identify him, and hold him there until our extraction team arrives.; 
Briefing.xml; Player; ; What extraction team?; 
Briefing.xml; Josiah; ; We've worked out a deal with a team of French contractors - former BFST.; 
Briefing.xml; Player; ; Can we trust them?; 
Briefing.xml; Josiah; ; Their leader is Frédéric Busson. I fought with him in Vietnam. I'd trust him with my life.; 
Briefing.xml; ; ; I guess there's little to gain from a low profile entry?; 
Briefing.xml; Josiah; ; If any bystanders see you sneaking around with a gun and a combat vest and calls the police, we'll have to abort - we simply cannot risk the gendarmes showing up with sirens blaring and scaring Grishin away.; 
Briefing.xml; Josiah; ; If you dress down, you'll have nothing to fear as long as you're outside the mansion, but of course the lack of protection could be a problem if you meet resistance inside.; 
Briefing.xml; ; ; This is the big one, then. Better get ready.; Trepidatious.
Briefing.xml; Josiah; ; Your flight leaves tomorrow. We'll re-establish contact once you're on-site. As always, good luck to you all.; 
Briefing.xml; ; ; Is Grishin going to be alone?; 
Briefing.xml; Sarah; ; It's not possible to predict what sort of resistance you'll meet, so we're taking all necessary precautions. One major concern is that Grishin seems to be on KS Global's payroll, but we don't know what for.; 
Briefing.xml; Player; ; The mercenaries from California. Makes sense - not an uncommon career path for a man with his training and experience, and it explains why Wen Zhi got them the security contract for Cerulean.; 
Briefing.xml; Sarah; ; Precisely my line of thinking. Problem being, he may have his own security detail from KS Global. We won't know until he disembarks in Paris.; 
Briefing.xml; ; ; Why not just send Busson's team in to get Grishin?; 
Briefing.xml; Josiah; ; I trust Busson, but I trust you more. I want a positive ID before we send in the extraction team.; 
Briefing.xml; Josiah; ; Your objectives are simple, but remember what's at stake. Check on the local assets, then carefully move in and search the premises for Grishin. Once you have an ID, we'll send the team to extract you both.; 
Briefing.xml; Player; ; And on the off-chance he's not there?; 
Briefing.xml; Josiah; ; Secure all intel at the site and exfiltrate with Martin.; 
Debriefing.xml; Josiah; ; Welcome--; Katya cuts him off half-way through "welcome back"
Debriefing.xml; Player; ; Next time you want to take on mercenaries, perhaps you should send an army.; Angry.
Debriefing.xml; Josiah; ; Settle down. I'm as surprised as you are. We had no indication of military security anywhere on the premises.; Stern.
Debriefing.xml; Player; ; Who were those guys? Do you even know?; Still upset.
Debriefing.xml; Sarah; ; KS Global, short for KönigStein - or KingStone - Global Solutions. Established in Germany in the late 80's, now wholly owned by the multinational private defence conglomerate Silures Group.; 
Debriefing.xml; Martin; ; That's some serious security for a bunch of software developers.; 
Debriefing.xml; Sarah; ; There's some indication that Wen Zhi arranged for KS Global to get the security contract for Spectrum, but it's justifiable, given the national security nature of Spectrum's work.; 
Debriefing.xml; Player; ; Is it possible that Adrasteia has some connection to KS?; 
Debriefing.xml; Sarah; ; It would appear so, but we have no knowledge yet of what this connection might be.; 
Debriefing.xml; Josiah; ; I can't really fault you for making a mess, seeing as how KS Global gave you a very nasty surprise. It is unfortunate, however, as this may well come back to bite us in the ass.; Regretful.
Debriefing.xml; Sarah; ; In that respect, I suppose it made sense to kill Wen Zhi. It just doesn't sit right with me, executing her like that.; 
Debriefing.xml; Player; ; She saw my face, and you had no extraction option ready. I couldn't let her go.; 
Debriefing.xml; Sarah; ; I know, I just... never mind.; 
Debriefing.xml; Josiah; ; Sarah's team will immediately get to work on the files from Wen Zhi's laptop. This Grishin character must be the source of our leaks, and Ms. Zhi seems to have been very close to him. We're in the home stretch now, I'm certain of that.; 
Debriefing.xml; Josiah; ; You'd better prepare well for the next operation. When we find Grishin, we must be ready to act fast. We only get one shot at this.; 
Debriefing.xml; Player; ; You had no extraction option ready. If she'd seen my face, we would be screwed.; 
Debriefing.xml; Sarah; ; I know you took a great risk letting Wen Zhi go, and I know it was a difficult decision. You did the right thing, though - she was no threat anymore, and we can't just go around executing people.; 
Debriefing.xml; Player; ; She saw my face. She's a huge danger to us now. Not to mention the damage she can still do to the Spectrum project. ; 
Debriefing.xml; Sarah; ; We've made sure the FBI and Cerulean's direction are aware that Zhi has other allegiances. She'll have no option other than to leave the United States as soon as possible.; 
Debriefing.xml; Player; ; She never saw my face, but she could still be a danger to us in the future - and to the Spectrum project.; 
Debriefing.xml; Josiah; ; The fact that we hadn't prepared you to handle KS Global makes your conduct all the more impressive. The FBI has been picking apart the building for days, but you left almost no evidence for them to find.; Appreciative.
Briefing.xml; Josiah; ; As you know, we've identified our next target. I'll let Sarah explain.; 
Briefing.xml; Sarah; ; I'll keep it short. Baxter's black book contains several mentions of an American tech corporation called Cerulean Communication Systems.; 
Briefing.xml; Martin; ; I know those guys. They made my router.; Grinning.
Briefing.xml; Sarah; ; In addition to making Martin's router, Cerulean has a very lucrative contract with the Department of Defence. Of course the purpose of their government project is highly classified, but Baxter seems to have had no small amount of knowledge of the project.; Smiling at first, then slipping back into business mode.
Briefing.xml; Sarah; ; According to Baxter's notes, Cerulean is developing some sort of mass surveillance system for the NSA, and Adrasteia has somehow managed to infiltrate the development team.; 
Briefing.xml; Martin; ; No shit? So we're on honest-to-god counter-intelligence duty now?; Impressed.
Briefing.xml; Josiah; ; Let the woman finish, Mr. Symborski.; Good-natured admonishment.
Briefing.xml; Sarah; ; It's fine. We still don't know who Adrasteia are or what they want, but Baxter has been directing funds to an agent named Magpie, with the purpose of penetrating Cerulean's black division Spectrum.; 
Briefing.xml; Sarah; ; By cross-referencing his notes with the records from London, we've identified Magpie as Wen Zhi, a former MI-6 officer out of Hong Kong.; 
Briefing.xml; Martin; ; Wow, good job.; Impressed.
Briefing.xml; Sarah; ; I have a good team.; 
Briefing.xml; Player; ; So Wen Zhi is our next target.; 
Briefing.xml; Josiah; ; Correct. As Sarah says, we don't know what Adrasteia's plans are, but if they've compromised an NSA project, they have access to some very dangerous infrastructure. I'm sure Martin can attest to that.; 
Briefing.xml; Martin; ; You don't know the half of it. The NSA is working on some incredibly scary things.; 
Briefing.xml; ; ; Is there any option for a low profile entry?; 
Briefing.xml; Josiah; ; Yulia Selezneva, your identity from Warsaw, now has a US social security number, and has graduated from call girl to IT quality assurance.; 
Briefing.xml; Sarah; ; We thought you might appreciate not having to memorise a new legend.; 
Briefing.xml; Josiah; ; Tell the receptionist you have a job interview with their QA lead. Martin will run interference to support your cover, and if you pull it off right, you'll be able to walk right in past security.; 
Briefing.xml; Josiah; ; Once you're inside, you'll have free reign of floors one through three. Unfortunately your objective is on the fourth floor, so you will need to be a little sneaky.; 
Briefing.xml; ; ; Tell us about Cerulean's offices.; 
Briefing.xml; Sarah; ; Cerulean operates out of a high tech office building in Palo Alto, California - in the heart of Silicon Valley.; 
Briefing.xml; Sarah; ; The building has four floors and houses all of the company's US operations: research, development, administration, customer service, and so on.; 
Briefing.xml; Player; ; What's security like?; 
Briefing.xml; Sarah; ; Physical security is provided by SafeGuard, whom you're familiar with from London.; 
Briefing.xml; Josiah; ; Unfortunately you made a mess in London, so SafeGuard has increased security at all of their high-value sites globally. Expect dense coverage, and lots of body armour.; 
Briefing.xml; ; ; What are our objectives?; 
Briefing.xml; Josiah; ; First, secure a meeting with Elizabeth Alix, the CTO of the company. She has privileged access to all Cerulean projects - she will be able to help us locate Wen Zhi and she can provide access to Spectrum if necessary.; 
Briefing.xml; Player; ; Call her secretary and book a meeting?; 
Briefing.xml; Josiah; ; Mrs. Alix has a very high security clearance, and therefore all her meetings are subject to extensive background checks. With our limited resources, it's unlikely we could provide a legend that would hold up to that kind of scrutiny.; 
Briefing.xml; Player; ; Do we have anything on that we can use as pressure points? ; 
Briefing.xml; Josiah; ; No, she's squeaky clean. We'll have to be a bit more crude than that.; 
Briefing.xml; Player; ; Wave my gun in her face until she gives us what we want. Got it.; Matter-of-fact.
Briefing.xml; ; ; Let's get going.; 
Briefing.xml; Josiah; ; Good. It's a 12 hour flight, so you'll have plenty of time to go over the details on the plane. Good luck to you both.; 
Briefing.xml; Josiah; ; Fortunately you left very little evidence in London, so SafeGuard thinks it was an inside job. Therefore they have not increased security at any of their sites.; 
RichardBaxter.xml; RichardBaxter; ; Plenty more people here with money, more foolish than I.; Condescending.
RichardBaxter.xml; RichardBaxter; ; I'm sure somebody here will fall for it.; Condescending.
RichardBaxter.xml; Player; ; Mr. Baxter, isn't it?; Flirtatious.
RichardBaxter.xml; RichardBaxter; ; In the market for a new client? I'm not interested.; Haughty.
RichardBaxter.xml; Player; ; I'm just looking for conversation...; Hesitant.
RichardBaxter.xml; RichardBaxter; ; Well pardon me for hurting your feelings, but I prefer more well educated company. Not that education abounds in this environment.; Arrogant.
RichardBaxter.xml; Player; ; Mr. Baxter...; One step away from pleading.
RichardBaxter.xml; RichardBaxter; ; Please. Find somebody else to pester. I'm not in the mood.; Dismissive.
RichardBaxter.xml; Martin; ; Sounds like you got shot down, Kat.; Slightly amused.
RichardBaxter.xml; Player; ; I'll show this posh asshole just how well educated I am...; Seething, but under her breath, to Martin on the radio.
RichardBaxter.xml; Martin; ; Listen, make another round of the party, see if anyone can offer you an in with Baxter.; Supportive and constructive.
Sarah.xml; Sarah; ; You did well in California. It's just... the loss of human life. But, I guess we've been over this. Is there anything I can help you with?; Glum.
Sarah.xml; Player; ; Do we know who Grishin is?; 
Sarah.xml; Sarah; ; Not with complete certainly. I did some digging while you were dealing with US customs, and I think I've got a pretty good idea of where to look, but I can't be sure until I get through the files from Wen Zhi's laptop.; 
Sarah.xml; Player; ; What about her, then? Zhi. What's her role in all this?; 
Sarah.xml; Sarah; ; As far as Martin tells me, it appears that she was compromising the security of the Spectrum project - sneaking back doors into the program, as he puts it. What for, we can only guess.; 
Sarah.xml; Player; ; And what is our guess?; 
Sarah.xml; Sarah; ; Personal profit, I would assume. Spectrum has potential to become a very powerful system, and any rogue agent with access to it would essentially have a license to print money.; 
Sarah.xml; Player; ; You think she's just a thief?; 
Sarah.xml; Sarah; ; She might have a greater goal in mind. There's no way to know.; 
Sarah.xml; Player; ; I'm not sure I understand how we got from a British financier laundering drug money for the mafia to a Chinese hacker putting holes in an American surveillance system.; 
Sarah.xml; Sarah; ; Whoever Grishin is, he's the key to it all. Baxter and Zhi both work for him. Baxter's activities fund Zhi's operation. The only thing we don't know is what Grishin was hoping to gain from Spectrum.; 
Sarah.xml; Sarah; ; Fantastic work in California. You had no idea what you were walking into, yet you still managed to get out of it in one piece and without too much collateral damage.; Cheerful.
RadioMessages.xml; Martin; ; Oh wow, would you look at this. The Preachers! I think you've found their base of operations!; Excited.
RadioMessages.xml; Player; ; Who are they?; 
RadioMessages.xml; Martin; ; Have you been living under a rock? They're infamous black hats.; 
RadioMessages.xml; Player; ; Why would Vatkov run a hacker group? That seems a little out of character.; 
RadioMessages.xml; Martin; ; I don't know... plug me in and let's see if we can find out.; 
RadioMessages.xml; Martin; ; It's Agnieszka, Vatkov's daughter. Sounds like she's the leader of The Preachers.; 
RadioMessages.xml; Player; ; I guess we should turn her in.; 
RadioMessages.xml; Martin; ; They've been stealing a lot of people's money... but she's only 19 years old. These guys are just kids.; Rueful.
RadioMessages.xml; Player; ; We could simply upload these files to the Polish police.; 
RadioMessages.xml; Martin; ; Or I could upload it to Wintermute, the old group I used to run with in SF. She's clearly a bright girl, but I mean... her dad is a drug lord. Maybe she just needs better role models.; Conflicted.
RadioMessages.xml; Player; ; I'll leave it up to you, Martin. You understand the situation better than I do.; Shrugging.
Martin.xml; Martin; ; Hey, good you're here.; 
Martin.xml; Player; ; What's up?; 
Martin.xml; Martin; ; I've found something interesting in the Preachers files. It looks like they've hacked Baxter. I dug out some Adrasteia chatter about a group or project within the CIA's Special Activities Division codenamed "Tantalus".; 
Martin.xml; Martin; ; The data is kinda vague unfortunately - it sounds like Adrasteia's operatives weren't themselves entirely clear on the nature of Tantalus.; 
Martin.xml; Martin; ; Sarah did a little bit of asking around, but we came up empty handed. It must be some black ops thing, and it all seems a little sinister.; 
Martin.xml; Player; ; What makes you say that?; 
Martin.xml; Martin; ; Well... in Adrasteia's communications, they refer to Tantalus as a threat to their continued operations, but also as a possible opportunity.; 
Martin.xml; Martin; ; It's kinda freaky that Adrasteia might have a reason to see an opportunity for themselves in an SAD black ops project, don't you think?; 
Martin.xml; Player; ; Doesn't sound like something we can do anything about.; 
Martin.xml; Martin; ; For now, we can't be sure it's relevant to our mission. We should keep an eye out for further data related to Tantalus - if nothing else, just to rule it out.; 
Martin.xml; Player; ; Do you regret turning the Preachers in to the police?; 
Martin.xml; Martin; ; Nah... it was the right thing to do. Hacking just for a laugh is one thing, but stealing people's pension savings and college funds is messed up.; 
Martin.xml; Martin; ; Hopefully those kids will get a reasonable punishment and manage to put their skills to better use in the future.; 
Martin.xml; Player; ; What do you think Wintermute will do with the Preachers data?; 
Martin.xml; Martin; ; I've asked them to contact Vatkov's daughter and scare her a little. Then if she gets the message, they can help her find a more constructive use for her skills.; 
Martin.xml; Martin; ; There's plenty of ways to make money off that sort of thing that don't involve theft.; 
Daniel.xml; Daniel; ; Ma'am, I don't know who you are, but your timing is impeccable.; Weary.
Daniel.xml; Player; ; Are you all right?; 
Daniel.xml; Daniel; ; Still in one piece, at least.; 
Daniel.xml; Player; ; Can you walk?; 
Daniel.xml; Daniel; ; Just about. Who the hell are you?; Friendly question.
Daniel.xml; Player; ; My name is Katya, I'm here to extract you.; 
Daniel.xml; Daniel; ; CIA?; 
Daniel.xml; Player; ; Not exactly. I'll explain when we're out of here.; 
Daniel.xml; Daniel; ; Ladies first.; 
Martin.xml; Martin; ; I've been listening to your wire, mostly Josiah's phone calls, and I've discovered something, uhm, disconcerting.; 
Martin.xml; Player; ; Do tell.; 
Martin.xml; Martin; ; Did you know we're not sanctioned?; 
Martin.xml; Player; ; What do you mean?; 
Martin.xml; Martin; ; Kingbridge does not have official sanction from the highest echelons of the CIA or the FSB.; 
Martin.xml; Player; ; But we do have support from both agencies.; 
Martin.xml; Martin; ; Not from people with any authority to create this kind of program. In fact it kind of sounds like nobody has authority to establish something like Kingbridge.; 
Martin.xml; Player; ; Then we better hope the higher ups don't find out.; 
Martin.xml; Martin; ; That's putting it mildly. We'd be court-martialled at the very least - at worst they'll install us permanently in the CIA's nearest black site!; 
Martin.xml; Player; ; Or left to rot in some prison in Siberia.; 
Martin.xml; Martin; ; All of us here, we're committing treason, just by associating with each other.; 
Martin.xml; Player; ; I should talk to Josiah about this.; 
Martin.xml; Martin; ; Better not - he'll want to know how you've heard about it.;
